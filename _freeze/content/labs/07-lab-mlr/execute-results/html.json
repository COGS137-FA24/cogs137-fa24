In the modelling lab we modeled evaluation scores using a single predictor at a time. However, this time we use multiple predictors to model evaluation scores.\n\nIf you don't remember the data, review the modelling lab's introduction before continuing to the exercises.\n\n::: callout-important\nThis lab is likely longer than what you'll be able to complete in an hour. We will be looking to see that you minimally ran *and interpreted* a model using multiple linear regression (completed Part 2). If you're able to finish the whole thing, awesome! If not, that's OK.\n:::\n\n# Getting started\n\nTo get started, accept the lab05 assignment (link on Canvas), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. Update the author name at the top of the .Rmd file in the YAML to be your name. And, then you're ready to go!\n\n# Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with the `tidyverse`, `broom`, and `tidymodels` packages. Be sure to import them prior to starting the lab.\n\n# The data\n\nIn this lab you will first read in the data ('evals-mod.csv') from the `data/` folder (provided in the template). Then, recreate the `bty_avg` variable as you did in the previous lab.\n\n# Exercises\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nLoad the data by including the appropriate code in your R Markdown file.\n\n## Part 1: Simple linear regression\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n\\[Review from linear regression lab\\] Fit a linear model (one you have fit before): `m_bty`, predicting average professor evaluation `score` based on average beauty rating (`bty_avg`) only. Write the linear model, and note the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n## Part 2: Multiple linear regression\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nFit a linear model: `m_bty_gen`, predicting average professor evaluation `score` based on average beauty rating (`bty_avg`) and `gender`. Write the linear model, and note the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nInterpret the slopes and intercept of `m_bty_gen` in context of the data.\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nWhat percent of the variability in `score` is explained by the model `m_bty_gen`.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nWhat is the equation of the line corresponding to *just* male professors?\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nFor two professors who received the same beauty rating, which gender tends to have the higher course evaluation score?\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nHow do the adjusted $R^2$ values of `m_bty_gen` and `m_bty` compare? What does this tell us about how useful `gender` is in explaining the variability in evaluation scores when we already have information on the beauty score of the professor.\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nCompare the slopes of `bty_avg` under the two models (`m_bty` and `m_bty_gen`). Has the addition of `gender` to the model changed the parameter estimate (slope) for `bty_avg`?\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nCreate a new model called `m_bty_rank` with `gender` removed and `rank` added in. Write the equation of the linear model and interpret the slopes and intercept in context of the data.\n\n## Part 3: The search for the best model\n\nGoing forward, only consider the following variables as potential predictors: `rank`, `ethnicity`, `gender`, `language`, `age`, `cls_perc_eval`, `cls_did_eval`, `cls_students`, `cls_level`, `cls_profs`, `cls_credits`, `bty_avg`.\n\n### Exercise 11\n\nWhich variable, on its own, would you expect to be the worst predictor of evaluation scores? Why? *Hint:* Think about which variable would you expect to not have any association with the professor's score.\n\n### Exercise 12\n\nCheck your suspicions from the previous exercise. Include the model output for that variable in your response.\n\n### Exercise 13\n\nSuppose you wanted to fit a full model with the variables listed above. If you are already going to include `cls_perc_eval` and `cls_students`, which variable should you not include as an additional predictor? Why?\n\n### Exercise 14\n\nFit a full model with all predictors listed above (except for the one you decided to exclude) in the previous question.\n\n### Exercise 15\n\nUsing backward-selection (meaning fit all predictors and remove those that are not needed in the model) with adjusted R-squared as the selection criterion, determine the *best* model. You do not need to show all steps in your answer, just the output for the final model. Also, write out the linear model for predicting score based on the final model you settle on.\n\n### Exercise 16\n\nInterpret the slopes of one numerical and one categorical predictor based on your final model.\n\n### Exercise 17\n\nBased on your final model, describe the characteristics of a professor and course at University of Texas at Austin that would be associated with a high evaluation score.\n\n### Exercise 18\n\nWould you be comfortable generalizing your conclusions to apply to professors generally (at any university)? Why or why not?\n",
