## Agenda

1.  Describe what this class is
2.  Describe how the class will run
3.  Go over the tooling for this course: R, RStudio, GitHub

## What is R?

<i class="fa fa-code fa"></i> : R is a statistical programming language.

While R has most/all of the functionality of **YFPL** (your favorite programming language), it was designed for the specific use of analyzing data.

## What is data science?

<i class="fa fa-laptop fa-lg"></i>: Data science is the scientific process of using data to answer interesting questions and/or solve important problems.

## Practical Data Science in R

::: incremental
-   Program at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language
-   Employ the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data
-   Explain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis
-   Communicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports

# Course Structure and Policies {background-color="#92A86A"}

## The General Plan

-   Learn R & the tidyverse
-   Use interesting case studies to do so
-   Do a project for your portfolio
-   w/ a focus on communication and group work

. . .

Note: This course has historically been back-loaded, as that's when group work has happened historically. I've tried to fix that this quarter by teaching from case studies from the beginning.

## The Nitty Gritty {.scrollable}

::: panel-tabset
### Lecture

**Class Meetings**

-   Interactive
-   Lectures & lots of learn-by-doing
-   Bring your laptop to class every day

### In-person

**In-person, synchronous learning**

1.  I will be teaching in person.
2.  Lectures and lab will be podcast.
3.  Attendance will be incentivized using a daily participation survey.
4.  If you're not feeling well, please stay home. I will do the same.

### Waitlist

**The (Dreaded) Waitlist**

-   Course enrollment is supposed to be 70 for this course
-   There are 100 people currently enrolled
-   I don't control the waitlist (cogsadvising\@ucsd.edu does)
-   I don't anticipate students being enrolled off of the waitlist (will be dependent on students dropping)

### Lab & OH

**Lab & Office Hours**

-   **Office hours** begin Friday** week 1
    -   Prof: Tu: 11A-12P (drop-in); W 10-11A (10 min slots; appt.)
-   **Lab** begins week 1 (next **Friday**)
    -   it's *not* in a computer lab, so you'll need to bring your own
    -   details about labs covered on Tues and in lab
    -   labs will always be released by Th night and due the following Th
-   I will hang out after class today for questions/concerns from students

### Materials

**Course Materials**

-   Textbooks are free and available online
-   Course platforms:
    -   Website : schedule, policies, due dates, etc.
    -   GitHub : retrieving assignments, labs, homework, etc.
    -   datahub : completing assignments, labs, homework, etc.
    -   Canvas : grades, course-specific links
    -   TBD : Q&A
:::

## Which Q&A Platform?

**Q**: Which Q&A Platform should we use this quarter? Discuss with your neighbor!  
</br>
**A**: Piazza, ClassQuestion, Slack, Canvas? Something else?  

Put a <font color="#32cb31">green</font> sticky on the front of your computer when you're done discussing. Put a <font color="#ff65a3">pink</font> if you have a question.

## Diversity & Inclusion:

**Goal**: every student be well-served by this course

. . .

**Philosophy:** The diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding.

. . .

**Plan:** Present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture)

. . .

**But...** if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! There is also an [anonymous Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/2nXnDNbgYuS1OsGF2) if you're more comfortable there.

## A new-ish course! {.scrollable}

-   Offered 3x previously...but changes significantly each time
-   If something doesn't make sense, tell me!
-   If you've got feedback/suggestions, I'm all ears!


## Changes since last iteration

(based on feedback):

- no midterm
- case studies from beginning
  - more focus on case studies/expectations
  - more examples of effective communication
- lab focused changed
  - more time for completing labs
  - removed super-structured labs
- improved final project
  - peer feedback
  - checkpoints on final project
- more in-class stuff/time

## How to get help {.scrollable}

-   Lab
-   Office Hours
-   Q&A


## Q&A 

A few (Q&A) guidelines:

```         
1. No duplicates.
2. Public posts are best.
3. Posts should include your question, what you've tried so far, & resources used.
4. Helping others is encouraged.
5. No assignment code in public posts.
6. We're not robots.

## Academic integrity

Don't cheat.

. . .

Teamwork is allowed, but you should be able to answer "Yes" to each of the following:

-   Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I'm submitting?
-   Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?

. . .

The Internet (including LLMS/ChatGPT) is a great resource. Cite your sources.

## When To (Can I) Use ChatGPT/LLMs?

For anything in this course.

## How To Use ChatGPT/LLMs

Probably never first or right away.

. . .

To learn: Think first. Try first. Then use external resources.

. . .

Always read/think about/understand the output.

## ChatGPT: What to Avoid

::: incremental
-   Over-reliance (thwarts learning)
-   Having to look *everything* up (wastes time)
-   Leaving tasks to the last minute (*can* lead to bad decisions/academic integrity issues)
-   Taking the output without thinking (thwarts learning; limits critical thinking practice)
-   Using it right away for brainstorming ideas (limits ideas generated)
:::

## Course components:

::: incremental
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Labs (7)</font>: Individual submission; graded on effort
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Homework (3)</font>: Individual submission; graded on correctness
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Case Studies (2)</font>: Team submission, technical analysis report + general communication
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Final Project (1) </font>: Team submission, due Tues of finals week w/ checkpoints prior
:::

## Grading

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

| Assignment (#)               | \% of grade     |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Labs (7)                     | 21% (3pt each)  |
| Homework (3)                 | 24% (8pt each)  |
| Case Study Projects\* (2)    | 30% (15pt each) |
| Final Project Proposal\* (1) | 3%              |
| Peer Review\* (1)            | 3%              |
| Final Report\* (1)           | 11%             |
| Final Presentation\* (1)     | 4%              |
| Team Evaluation Surveys (3)  | 3% (1pt each)   |

: \* indicates group submission

## Late/missed work policy

-   Homework and case study projects: accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline for a 25% deduction

-   No late deadlines for labs or the final project

. . .

Note: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.

# Tooling {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Datahub

Datahub is a platform hosted by UCSD that gives students access to computational resources.

This means that while you'll be typing on your keyboard, you'll be *using* UCSD's computers in this class.

Website: <https://datahub.ucsd.edu/>

. . .

**Launch Environment**

When working on "stuff" for this course, select the COGS 137 environment.

![datahub](images/00/datahub.png) \

## Datahub Usage

Q: Do I *have* to use datahub?

A: Nope. You could download and install all the packages we use and complete the course locally! However, many packages have already been installed for you on datahub, so it will be a tiny bit more work up front...but you won't be dependent on the internet/datahub!

## Toolkit

![](images/00/toolkit.png)

-   Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

-   Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

-   The Internet (Google/ChatGPT/etc.)

## R and RStudio {.scrollable}

::: panel-tabset
### R/RStudio

**R & RStudio**

-   R is a statistical programming language
-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integreated development environment, IDE)

### Tour

::: {.hand-green style="text-align: center;"}
<center>\[DEMO\]</center>
:::

Concepts introduced:

-   Console
-   Using R as a calculator
-   Environment
-   Loading and viewing a data frame
-   Accessing a variable in a data frame
-   R functions

### Try

**Your Turn**

::: task
1.  Login to datahub
2.  Carry out a mathematical operation in the console
3.  View the `airquality` dataframe
4.  Access a column from the `airquality` dataframe
5.  Calculate the median for one of the numeric columns
:::

Put a <font color="#32cb31">green</font> sticky on the front of your computer when you're done. Put a <font color="#ff65a3">pink</font> if you want help/have a question.

### R packages

-   **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data [^1]
-   As of Sept 2024, there are \~21,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)[^2]
-   We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!
:::

[^2]: [CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

## What is the Tidyverse?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/00/tidyverse.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
<center><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse.org</a></center>

-   The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common syntax.
:::
:::

## RStudio Projects[^3]

[^3]: [RStudio Projects Documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

-   Built-in functionality to keep all files for a single project organized

## R Markdown

-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit, the document is executed from top to bottom
-   Simple markdown syntax for text
-   Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## R Markdown tips

-   Keep the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and Markdown Quick Reference (Help -\> Markdown Quick Reference) handy, we'll refer to it often as the course progresses

-   The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console

<br><br>

::: {.hand-green style="text-align: center;"}
<center>\[DEMO\]</center>
:::

## How will we use R Markdown?

-   Every lab / case study / project / homework / notes / etc. is an R Markdown document
-   You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the quarter

## Collaboration: Git & GitHub

-   The statistical programming language we'll use is R
-   The software we use to interface with R is RStudio
-   But how do I get you the course materials that you can build on for your assignments?
    -   I'm not going to email you documents, that would be a mess!

## Version control

-   We introduced GitHub as a platform for collaboration
-   But it's much more than that...
-   It's actually designed for version control

## Versioning

![Lego versions](images/00/lego-steps.png)

## Versioning

with human readable messages

![Lego versions with commit messages](images/00/lego-steps-commit-messages.png)

## Why do we need version control?

![PhD Comics](images/00/phd_comics_vc.gif)

## Git and GitHub tips {.scrollable}

-   Git is a **version control** system -- like "Track Changes" feature Google Docs...but optimized for code. GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like Drive with additional features for code.

. . .

-   There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. **99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull**.

. . .

-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

::: aside
Resource: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/): book for working with git in R; Some content is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good resource
:::

## Let's take a tour -- Git / GitHub

**We'll cover this time permitting, you'll see it again in lab next week**

Concepts introduced:

-   Connect an R project to Github repository
-   Working with a local and remote repository
-   Committing, Pushing and Pulling

There is a bit more of GitHub that we'll use in this class, but for today this is enough.
