Describe what this class is\n2.  Describe how the class will run\n3.  Go over the tooling for this course: R, RStudio, GitHub\n\n## What is R?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-code fa\"></i> : R is a statistical programming language.\n\nWhile R has most/all of the functionality of **YFPL** (your favorite programming language), it was designed for the specific use of analyzing data.\n\n## What is data science?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-laptop fa-lg\"></i>: Data science is the scientific process of using data to answer interesting questions and/or solve important problems.\n\n## Practical Data Science in R\n\n::: incremental\n-   Program at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\n-   Employ the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\n-   Explain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis\n-   Communicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n:::\n\n## Who am I?\n\nShannon Ellis: Associate Teaching Professor, Mom & wife, volleyball-obsessed, and baking & cooking lover\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-envelope\"></i>   [sellis\\@ucsd.edu](mailto:sellis@ucsd.edu) <br> <i class=\"fa fa-home\"></i>   [shannon-ellis.com](https://shannon-ellis.com/) <br> <i class=\"fa fa-university\"></i>  CSB 002 <br> <i class=\"fa fa-calendar\"></i>   Tu/Th 2-3:20PM (Lab: Fri 2-2:50 (RWAC 0103) or Mon 5-5:50 (DIB 121))\n\n## Course Staff\n\n| Quirine (Q) van-Engen (TA) | Eric Song     (IA) |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| ![](images/00/q.jpg)        | ![](images/00/eric.jpg)    |\n\n## What is this course? {.scrollable}\n\nEverything you want to know about the course, and everything you will need for the course will be posted at: <https://cogs137-fa24.github.io/cogs137-fa24/>\n\n::: incremental\n-   Is this an intro CS course? No.\n-   Will we be doing computing? Yes.\n-   What computing language will we learn? R.\n-   Is this an intro stats course? No.\n-   Will we be doing stats? Yes.\n-   Are there any prerequisites? Yes, an intro statistics course!\n:::\n\n## So...I don't have to know how to program already?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](images/00/r_first_then.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nNope! The first few weeks of the course will be all about getting **comfortable using the R programming language**!\n\n<br/> After that, we'll focus on delving into interesting statistical analyses through **case studies**.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: footer\nArtwork by [\\@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allison_horst\" title=\"allison_horst\"><i class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></i></a>\n:::\n\n# Course Structure and Policies {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## The General Plan\n\n-   Learn R & the tidyverse\n-   Use interesting case studies to do so\n-   Do a project for your portfolio\n-   w/ a focus on communication and group work\n\n. . .\n\nNote: This course has historically been back-loaded, as that's when group work has happened historically. I've tried to fix that this quarter by teaching from case studies from the beginning.\n\n## The Nitty Gritty {.scrollable}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Lecture\n\n**Class Meetings**\n\n-   Interactive\n-   Lectures & lots of learn-by-doing\n-   Bring your laptop to class every day\n\n### In-person\n\n**In-person, synchronous learning**\n\n1.  I will be teaching in person.\n2.  Lectures and lab will be podcast.\n3.  Attendance will be incentivized using a daily participation survey.\n4.  If you're not feeling well, please stay home. I will do the same.\n\n### Waitlist\n\n**The (Dreaded) Waitlist**\n\n-   Course enrollment is supposed to be 70 for this course\n-   There are 100 people currently enrolled\n-   I don't control the waitlist (cogsadvising\\@ucsd.edu does)\n-   I don't anticipate students being enrolled off of the waitlist (will be dependent on students dropping)\n\n### Lab & OH\n\n**Lab & Office Hours**\n\n-   **Office hours** begin Friday** week 1\n    -   Prof: Tu: 11A-12P (drop-in); W 10-11A (10 min slots; appt.)\n-   **Lab** begins week 1 (next **Friday**)\n    -   it's *not* in a computer lab, so you'll need to bring your own\n    -   details about labs covered on Tues and in lab\n    -   labs will always be released by Th night and due the following Th\n-   I will hang out after class today for questions/concerns from students\n\n### Materials\n\n**Course Materials**\n\n-   Textbooks are free and available online\n-   Course platforms:\n    -   Website : schedule, policies, due dates, etc.\n    -   GitHub : retrieving assignments, labs, homework, etc.\n    -   datahub : completing assignments, labs, homework, etc.\n    -   Canvas : grades, course-specific links\n    -   TBD : Q&A\n:::\n\n## Which Q&A Platform?\n\n**Q**: Which Q&A Platform should we use this quarter? Discuss with your neighbor!  \n</br>\n**A**: Piazza, ClassQuestion, Slack, Canvas? Something else?  \n\nPut a <font color=\"#32cb31\">green</font> sticky on the front of your computer when you're done discussing. Put a <font color=\"#ff65a3\">pink</font> if you have a question.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion:\n\n**Goal**: every student be well-served by this course\n\n. . .\n\n**Philosophy:** The diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding.\n\n. . .\n\n**Plan:** Present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture)\n\n. . .\n\n**But...** if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! There is also an [anonymous Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/2nXnDNbgYuS1OsGF2) if you're more comfortable there.\n\n## A new-ish course! {.scrollable}\n\n-   Offered 3x previously...but changes significantly each time\n-   If something doesn't make sense, tell me!\n-   If you've got feedback/suggestions, I'm all ears!\n\n\n## Changes since last iteration\n\n(based on feedback):\n\n- no midterm\n- case studies from beginning\n  - more focus on case studies/expectations\n  - more examples of effective communication\n- lab focused changed\n  - more time for completing labs\n  - removed super-structured labs\n- improved final project\n  - peer feedback\n  - checkpoints on final project\n- more in-class stuff/time\n\n## How to get help {.scrollable}\n\n-   Lab\n-   Office Hours\n-   Q&A\n\n\n## Q&A \n\nA few (Q&A) guidelines:\n\n```         \n1. No duplicates.\n2. Public posts are best.\n3. Posts should include your question, what you've tried so far, & resources used.\n4. Helping others is encouraged.\n5. No assignment code in public posts.\n6.
