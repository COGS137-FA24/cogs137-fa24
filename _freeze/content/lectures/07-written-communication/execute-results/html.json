And, we'll discuss more of this today. But, also, check out [this piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/m1jv2820hu54m/post/60).\n\n> Q: Would sensitivity and specificity be related to type I and type II errors? \\\n> A: Yes! Type I Error (measured as 1-Specificity) is known as the false positive rate. Type II Error (1- Sensitivity) is also known as the false negative rate. These concepts are directly related.\n\n\n\n## [ad] CSS Masters Program\n\n![](images/07/CSS.png)\nAbout the CSS MS Program: \n\nUC San Diego's one-year M.S. in Computational Social Science combines coursework approaches and formal models across social science disciplines with modern computational data analysis techniques. With a hands-on curriculum involving a summer bootcamp, core foundational training, in-depth electives across fields, and a portfolio-building capstone project, this program provides substantive and wide-ranging practice applying skill sets to real-world problems preparing graduates for careers in industry, public policy, education, non-profits, or for further academic study in a Ph.D. program. \n\n## [ad] COGS Transfers\n\n![](images/07/transfers.png)\n\n## Course Announcements\n\n**Due Dates**:\n\n- üî¨ **Lab 04** due Thursday (11:59 PM)\n- üìã Lecture Participation survey \"due\" after class\n- üíª [mid-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYyxJ-UkBMbSabSYtvhmY9NuQwtt4XabIj-OkSHEgRpRrhEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) now available (due Fri at 11:59 PM)\n\nNotes: \n- lab 03 scores and feedback posted; everyone received feedback; check GH issue\n- lab 05 is available and the focus this Fri/Mon lab...but not due until after CS01. Best to do it before CS01, as it will help CS01 completion\n- Thursday will be semi-guided class time for working on your case study.
