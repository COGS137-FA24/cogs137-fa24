And, then you're ready to go!\n\n# Packages\n\nThe only package required for completion of this lab is `tidyverse`, as `dplyr` (which you'll be using a lot in this lab) is one of the packages in the `tidyverse`. Be sure to import the `tidyverse` prior to completing the lab.\n\n# Data\n\nThe three data files you'll be using in this lab have been provided in the `data/` folder. You'll see the following three lines in the provided .Rmd template for this lab, which, when run, will read each of the files into R for you:\n\n``` r\nWB <- read_csv(\"data/WB\")\nOF <- read_csv(\"data/OF.csv\")\nBR <- read_csv(\"data/Breath.csv\")\n```\n\n# Exercises\n\n### Exercise 1: **Whole Blood**\n\nUsing the CS01 wrangling code from the `dplyr` lecture [here](https://cogs137-fa24.github.io/cogs137-fa24/content/lectures/03-dplyr.html#cs01-wrangling), wrangle the whole blood data as we did in class.\n\n### Exercise 2: **Oral Fluid**\n\nIn a *similar* manner to how the whole blood data were wrangled and cleaned, carry out wrangling on the oral fluid dataset, accomplishing the following:\n\n-   `Treatment` re-coded and re-leveled as was done with WB\n-   `Group` re-coded as with WB\n-   column names cleaned using `clean_names()` as with WB\n-   The following columns renamed: `thcoh = x11_oh_thc`; `thcv = thc_v`; `fluid_type=fluid`\n-   The following `timepoints` (note these are different than WB): `\"pre-smoking\",\"0-30 min\",\"31-90 min\",\"91-180 min\", \"181-210 min\", \"211-240 min\",\"241-270 min\", \"271+ min\"`\n\n### Exercise 3: **Breath**\n\nIn a *similar* manner to both previous datatasets, carry out wrangling on the breath dataset, accomplishing the following:\n\n-   `Treatment` re-coded and re-leveled as was done with WB/OF\n-   `Group` re-coded as with WB/OF\n-   column names cleaned using `clean_names()` as with WB/OF\n-   The following columns renamed: `thc = thc_pg_pad`; `fluid_type=fluid`\n-   The following `timepoints` (note these are different than WB/OF): `\"pre-smoking\",\"0-40 min\",\"41-90 min\", \"91-180 min\", \"181-210 min\", \"211-240 min\", \"241-270 min\", \"271+ min\"`\n\n### Exercise 4: **Combine** (*time-permitting*)\n\nCombine all three datasets into a single dataframe. Note that there is a function in `dplyr` called `bind_rows()` for accomplishing such a task.\n\nSave the file as a CSV file using the `write_csv()` function so that you have this file to start from in the future. (You do *not* need to submit this to GH; we're doing it so that you have it.)\n\nYou'll likely have to look up the documentation for each of these functions as they have not been directly covered in class yet.\n\n### Exercise 5: **Summarize**\n\nIn your own words (no code needed), describe the wrangling that was done overall, focusing on why it was done or what it achieved, rather than on specific lines of code.\n\n# Submit\n\n::: callout-important\nYou'll always want to knit your RMarkdown document to HTML and review that HTML document to ensure it includes all the information you want and looks as you intended, as we grade from the knit HTML.\n:::\n\n*Yay, you're done! To finish up and submit, **first knit your file to HTML**. Be sure to select both your .Rmd and .html documents when choosing what to commit! Then, commit all remaining changes, use the commit message \"Done with Lab 2! ðŸ’ª\", and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.*\n",
