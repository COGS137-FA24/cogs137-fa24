Is \"m_ht_wt\" supposed be a model? \\\n> A: Yup, this model was the height by weight model:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm_ht_wt <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Q: I was not too sure what was going on when talking about the relationship between painting height and school. \\\n> A: I don't think you were the only one confused! Briefly here (and I'm happy to chat more before/after class and in OH), we were looking to determine/quantify the relationship between the size (height) of a painting and the school from which the painting originated. This was an example of having more than two categories for a categorical (factor) predictor. The important points were undersatnding that each level is compared to the baseline *and* the linear model that results from multiple categories. Part 4 of the lab gets into this a bit more too. Definitely follow up if you're unsure after doing that part of the lab!\n\n> Q: How do you calculate the linear regression model when you have non-numeric values? For example, on lab 04, when it asks to calculate the linear regression model by gender, the gender appears only as male and female. Suppose male is 1 and female is 0 (interpreted by the function), then male linear regression model is y =ax + 1? \\\nA: Close! the \"1\" would be plugged in as the value of x (in what you suggested)m not for the intercept. So the function would be $y=\\beta_1*1 + \\beta_0$\n\n\n## Course Announcements\n\n- Lab04 due Friday\n- HW02 due Monday\n\n. . . \n\n-   Practice Midterms Now Available \n    -   answers posted next week\n-   **Midterm Exam**\n    -   will cover material through \"Multiple Linear Regression\"\n    -   will be released/posted next Friday *after* lab\n    -   will be **due Monday Nov 6th at 11:59 PM**\n    -   will be an Rmd document and submitted via GitHub (like everything so far)\n    -   will be completed *individually* (open Notes; open Internet)\n\n. . .\n\n-   [Link for Later](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9dyocixWJGHjmU3P8Peli5FePchGBFoZOfw93ibnjWWJ8xg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n. . .\n\n![](images/08/qr.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Agenda\n\n-   Communicating for your audience\n-   Oral Communication\n-   Written Communication\n-   Visual Communication\n\n## Suggested Reading\n\n-   Bookdown [Section 2.6 R Code Chunks & inline R code](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html)\n-   Bookdown [Chapter 3: Documents](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)\n-   Will Chase's rstudio::conf2020 talk: \"The Glamour of Graphics\" \\[[slides](https://www.williamrchase.com/slides/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html)\\] \\[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cTacaWE6I)\\]\n\n# Consider your audience {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## What does this mean?\n\n[‚ùì What does it mean to \"consider your audience?\"]{style=\"background-color: #ADD8E6\"}\n\n. . .\n\nSimply: **You do the work so they don't have to.**\n\n. . .\n\n...also the aesthetic-usability effect exists.\n\n## What's the right level?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**General Audience**\\\n‚úî background\\\nüö´ limit technical details\\\nüéâ emphasize take-home\\\n\n![](images/08/general.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Technical Audience**\\\n‚¨á limit background\\\nüíª all-the-details\\\nüéâ emphasize take-home\\\n\n![](images/08/technical.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Considerations\n\n-   **Platform**: written? oral?\n\n. . .\n\n-   **Setting**: informal? formal?\n\n. . .\n\n-   **Timing**: never go over your time limit!\n\n## Storytelling\n\n-   Stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\n. . .\n\n-   Stories do not need *every* detail of what you've tried\n\n. . .\n\n-   Reports and presentations should tell a story\n-   Planning out your report/presentation can help\n\n. . .\n\n-   Hold the audience's attention with what needs to be said; do so effectively\n-   Tell your audience why they should care; why it matters\n-   You should explain your choices and the \"why\"\n\n## Choose informative titles\n\nOn **presentations**: Balance b/w short and informative (goal: concise)\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}\nAvoid: \"Analyzing NHANES\"\n:::\n\nBetter: \"Data from the NHANES study shows that diet is related to overall health\"\n\n. . .\n\nOn **visualizations**: emphasize the take-home!
