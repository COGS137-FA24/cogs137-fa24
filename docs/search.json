    "text": "Class\nClass will include short lectures, interactive activities, and time for group work. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course and get initial practice. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to further practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we’ll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\nCourse components\n\nLecture\nLectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is encouraged if you’re feeling well. To help incentivize coming to class, there will be a daily participation survey that will open at the end of lecture and close shortly after each Tues/Thurs lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project Completion of all surveys will provide 0.8% extra credit on your final grade.\n\nReadings\nReadings will be suggested for some class days and are best completed prior to the day’s lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day’s lecture topics. These can also be a good source after class when studying or reviewing topics discussed in class.\n\n\nPodcast\nIn case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts here.\n\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are meant to give you deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will typically comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask and answer each others’ questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.\nLabs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn a lot from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week’s lab.\nLab attendance is not required, but is definitely encouraged if you are feeling well as you’ll learn a lot by engaging with others’ ideas and getting questions answered in real-time.\n\n\nHomework\nAfter practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You are allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two case study mini-projects and a final project. Teams will be randomly assigned for the first case study, but you all will select your team for the second case study and final project (which will both be completed in the same team). By working with teammates throughout the course, you will also be able to use one another as a resource during labs and assignments.\n\nCase Studies\nWe will use case studies throughout the course to guide our learning of both programming in R and using that to analyze data. Specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the case studies, you will: 1) carry out the analysis presented in class as a group, 2) extend the analysis from class and 3) communicate your findings for both a technical and general audience.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will be completed in groups, where each group will carry out a data analysis on a topic and dataset of their choosing. Final Project groups will have to submit a proposal during week 7, a rough draft during week 9, will submit/receive peer feedback during week 10, and their final submissions Tues of finals week by 11:59 PM.\nFinal project submissions will include a 1) detailed data science report, 2) short (3-5 min) presentation of the project and 3) a general audience communication.\nProject groups will have the opportunity to present their projects to the class for extra credit during week 10. Groups that do not present to the class will submit their presentation as a recording.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade will be comprised of the following:\n\n\n\nAssignment (#)\n% of grade\n\n\n\n\nLabs (7)\n21% (3pt each)\n\n\nHomework (3)\n24% (8pt each)\n\n\nCase Study Projects* (2)\n30% (15pt each)\n\n\nFinal Project Proposal* (1)\n3%\n\n\nPeer Review* (1)\n3%\n\n\nFinal Report* (1)\n11%\n\n\nFinal Presentation* (1)\n4%\n\n\nTeam Evaluation Surveys (3)\n3% (1pt each)\n\n\n\n* indicates group submission\n\nFinal Grades\nTo calculate final grades, I use the standard grading scale and do not round grades up (given the numerous extra credit opportunities offered):\n\n\n\n97-100%\nA+\n\n\n93-96%\nA\n\n\n90-92%\nA-\n\n\n87-89%\nB+\n\n\n83-86%\nB\n\n\n80-82%\nB-\n\n\n77-79%\nC+\n\n\n73-76%\nC\n\n\n70-72%\nC-\n\n\n67-69%\nD+\n\n\n63-66%\nD\n\n\n60-62%\nD-\n\n\n&lt;60%\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate / missed work\nLate homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.\nThere are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.\nNote: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nWe will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you’ve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it’s important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post privately on Campuswire to “Instructors” using the “regrades” tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMy goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end. If you would like to provide that feedback anonymously, please use the anonymous Google Form.*\n\nWhat should you call me?\nMost students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that’s great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I’m also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis.\n\n\nWhat I should call you?\nI should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or online after the fact…however you’re most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.\n\n\n\nDisability Access\nStudents requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out to Professor Ellis directly.\nContacting the OSD can help you further:\n858.534.4382 (phone)\nosd@ucsd.edu (email)\nhttp://disabilities.ucsd.edu\n\n\nHow to get help\nClass time, lab, and office hours are all great! Online communication works too, via either the class Q&A platform or email. If contacting by email, it’s best to include COGS 137 in the subject line.\nBut, if you prefer to be anonymous (i.e. If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly), please fill out the anonymous Google Form*.\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon’t cheat.\nYou are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can be to ask yourself “Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I’m submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?”; you should be able to answer “Yes” to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you’ve submitted. (For the midterm, all work has to be completed individually and communication with other humans about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly beforehand.)\nA note on sharing / reusing code: The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You should use available resources (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, StackOverflow, etc.), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g. copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.\nPlease review UCSD’s academic integrity policies here.\nCheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing (sellis@ucsd.edu) your assignment as soon as possible to avoid it being graded as late.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nPlease refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)\n\n\nClassroom Observation Study\nThis quarter, I am taking part in a research study (NSF IUSE 2236318) investigating how STEM instructors use data about their own teaching practices to reflect on and iterate upon their practices.\nAs part of this study, two weeks of class will be video recorded. The first week of recordings will occur in week 2/3 of the quarter and the second week of recordings will occur in week 8/9.\nThe recordings will be centered on my instruction and not on you. Given that the purpose of this study is to accurately capture my teaching, it is important that you continue to behave as you normally would without video recording. Only members of the study team will have access to the video recordings and the raw data files will be stored on a password-protected Google Drive. Upon completion of the study, the video recordings will be deleted.",

And, this is definitely the right attitude! Lecture is for first exposure. Practice in lecture is to start underestanding. Labs are for guided practice where you have more time to practice. Case studies and homeworks are where we check our understanding! So, you’re not supposed to “get it” all the first time you see it in lecture."

It’s always easier/faster to pick up a new programming language with familiarity in a prior language. Python would be the most similar to R from a design perspective, but there will still be R quirks. That said, if you’ve used `pandas` in python for data analysis, that will be very overlapping.\n\n\nQ: Is attendance required to attend? I know the lectures are recorded, but I want to make sure I’m not missing out on anything if I were unable to attend for some reason.\nA: You can only get the lecture attendance extra credit by being in class on any given day, but that’s just extra credit. Nothing else is required. That said, I will be forming groups within those who regularly come to class for CS01 and there will be time to work on stuff in class.

If the survey is still open, you can submit. 2. Yes! I will be assigning group among people who regularly come to class. If you miss a day or two, that’s ok!\n\n\nQ: I’m not sure if I missed this in lecture but what is the difference between Rstudio and R, and when do we know which one to use.\nA: RStudio is the environment where we write R code. We’ll be using RStudio exclusively…so RStudio will be your go to!\n\n\nQ: Could the lecture survey be due at the end of the day instead?\nA: I’ll think on this!

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: How much of my experience in Java, C++, and Python help me with R?\nA: Tons! It’s always easier/faster to pick up a new programming language with familiarity in a prior language. Python would be the most similar to R from a design perspective, but there will still be R quirks. That said, if you’ve used `pandas` in python for data analysis, that will be very overlapping.\n\n\nQ: Is attendance required to attend? I know the lectures are recorded, but I want to make sure I’m not missing out on anything if I were unable to attend for some reason.\nA: You can only get the lecture attendance extra credit by being in class on any given day, but that’s just extra credit. Nothing else is required. That said, I will be forming groups within those who regularly come to class for CS01 and there will be time to work on stuff in class. So, helpful to come, but not required.\n\n\nQ: Will assignments show up in DataHub?\nA: They won’t, but we’ll talk about how/where to access them today/on Tues.\n\n\nQ: I’m wondering how library imports work like in Python or if that’s even a thing in R!\nA: It is a thing and we’ll definitely get into it! There’s a package for almost everything in R (just like in python)\n\n\nQ: If you don’t submit the survey on time, will you still be assigned to the group of people that aren’t synchronously going to class?\nA: 1. If the survey is still open, you can submit. 2. Yes! I will be assigning group among people who regularly come to class. If you miss a day or two, that’s ok!\n\n\nQ: I’m not sure if I missed this in lecture but what is the difference between Rstudio and R, and when do we know which one to use.\nA: RStudio is the environment where we write R code. We’ll be using RStudio exclusively…so RStudio will be your go to!\n\n\nQ: Could the lecture survey be due at the end of the day instead?\nA: I’ll think on this! It will always be open for at least an hour."

Do we need to know a lot of how to code those examples from class?\nA: Love that you’re noting and questioning these things. We’re going to discuss this today! You do not need to know the code examples…yet. We’re going to discuss code starting today; this starts with what you’ll need to be familiar with.\n\n\nQ: How to really extend the case study in our own time, when many information/analysis are already given in the lecture?\nA: We’ll discuss this more! But, specifically for this first Case Study. We’re asking a very narrow question….but have a lot of variables. Is there some subgroup you could focus on? A different time window? A combination of compounds? Etc.\n\n\nQ: How can we do more complex math in R?\nA: Depends on what kind of complex math you’re aiming to do - a lot of complex math is built directly into R; other things would require additional packages.\n\n\nQ: Where can I find the full study on the data we reviewed in class. Seems like something I’d like to read and perhaps play with the data myself.\nA: We’re going to discuss the results today! But, the links are inlcuded in the notes (in what we didn’t get to yet.)\n\n\nQ: How did the police officers do to detect cognitive impariedness with marijuana consumption?\nA: Not great (not better than flipping a coin). We’ll discuss this today!\n\n\nQ: Why were the numeric types in the cat lovers data frame labeled as ‘dbl’ instead of numeric?\nA: There are multiple “levels” of object type in R (which I did not make clear in lecture b/c it’s not important for this class). Double is a subset of numeric. If you ask for type() rather than class() you’ll see this difference.\n\n\nQ: In class, we used |&gt; as a pipe operator. Is it fine if we use %&gt;% instead? Do you have a preference between the two? Thank you!\nA: We’ll discuss this today - no preference!\n\n\nQ: My github username is pretty weird.

Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.\nfactors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.\n\n\n\nSource: forcats.tidyverse.org",

We’re going to discuss this today! You do not need to know the code examples…yet. We’re going to discuss code starting today; this starts with what you’ll need to be familiar with.\n\n\nQ: How to really extend the case study in our own time, when many information/analysis are already given in the lecture?\nA: We’ll discuss this more! But, specifically for this first Case Study. We’re asking a very narrow question….but have a lot of variables. Is there some subgroup you could focus on? A different time window? A combination of compounds? Etc.\n\n\nQ: How can we do more complex math in R?\nA: Depends on what kind of complex math you’re aiming to do - a lot of complex math is built directly into R; other things would require additional packages.\n\n\nQ: Where can I find the full study on the data we reviewed in class. Seems like something I’d like to read and perhaps play with the data myself.\nA: We’re going to discuss the results today! But, the links are inlcuded in the notes (in what we didn’t get to yet.)\n\n\nQ: How did the police officers do to detect cognitive impariedness with marijuana consumption?\nA: Not great (not better than flipping a coin). We’ll discuss this today!\n\n\nQ: Why were the numeric types in the cat lovers data frame labeled as ‘dbl’ instead of numeric?\nA: There are multiple “levels” of object type in R (which I did not make clear in lecture b/c it’s not important for this class). Double is a subset of numeric. If you ask for type() rather than class() you’ll see this difference.\n\n\nQ: In class, we used |&gt; as a pipe operator. Is it fine if we use %&gt;% instead? Do you have a preference between the two? Thank you!\nA: We’ll discuss this today - no preference!\n\n\nQ: My github username is pretty weird. How are the professor and TA going to know that it is me if my username does not resemble my actual name?\nA: On your first lab, we ask you to put your name in the author field. We use that to match students to their GH usernames!"

Now, it’s your turn to apply what you learned by recreating someone else’s visualization.\n\nQuestion 1\nFor this question, find a well-designed visualization somewhere on the Internet that you think does a good job displaying important or interesting information and recreate the visualization as close as you can using ggplot2.\nTo make this easier on yourself, you’ll likely want to find a visualization where the data are readily available. (To get started, FiveThirtyEight makes a lot of the data from their articles available and has many charts in their articles. You are not required to recreate a visualization from FiveThirtyEight; however, if you’re not sure where to start, you have this option.) Your answer should include an image of the original visualization, a reference to the original image (this could simply be a URL), and your code + recreation.\nNotes:\n\nTo insert an image in an RMarkdown document, you can use the syntax ![alt text](path/to/image.png).\nThe R/ggplot2 code to create your visualization cannot already exist on the internet. (For example, choosing to recreate a plot from the R Graph Gallery would not be an option because all the code is already there and you wouldn’t learn as much.)\nAdditional sources of strong visualizations: NYT Graphics and their yearly roundup incl. other sources; The Economist\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nBriefly explain what you learned about ggplot2 in the process of re-creating this visualization.\n\n\nQuestion 3\nExplain how your visualization differs from the original (It’s OK if your plot is not a perfect recreation!)",

The idea here is that there is a lot of data all around us and a whole bunch of visualizations. Some of them are really excellent, and some could be improved. Choose a less-than-ideal visualization you’ve created in the past OR a visualization you’ve found out in the world that could benefit from a redesign and/or significant visual improvement. Your answer should include an image of the original visualization, a reference to the original image (this could simply be a URL), and your code + improved version.\nNote: If you’re unsure where to look for visualizations that would benefit from improvement, check out Flowing Data’s Ugly Charts or Reddit’s Data is ugly. You may need to recreate/approximate the dataset (meaning store the values from the visualization in a tibble) needed to generate the visualization prior to improving the design.

Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub…and so you do not have to type in your username and password every time you want to communicate with GitHub from RStudio. A video here showing what these steps look like or feel free to follow the written instructions below:\n\n\nStep 1: Email and Username\nThe first step requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Terminal pane\nType the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:\n\n\ngit config --global user.email \"your email\"\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\"\n\nFor example, for me these are:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"sellis@ucsd.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"ShanEllis\"\n\nTo confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:\n\ngit config --global user.email\ngit config --global user.name\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate ssh key\nIn the terminal, you’ll want to generate an ssh key by typing:\n\nssh-keygen\n\nAfter hitting enter/return to execute the above, you’ll press return/enter three times to bypass specifying a location and passphrase.\n\n\nStep 3: Copy your ssh key\nFrom the terminal type:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nYou’ll want to highlight and copy the full result of this command. It will start with ssh-rsa and end with something including dsmlp toward the end.\n\n\nStep 4: Let GitHub know your key\n\nIn your browser, navigate to https://github.com/settings/keys\nClick “New SSH Key”\nSet title to DSMLP\nPaste what you copied in step 3 into the “Key” box\nClick “Add SSH Key”\n\n\n\nStep 5: Finalize\nReturn to the terminal in RStudio and run the following command:\n\nssh git@github.com\n\nYou may see a message like `The authenticity of host … can’t be established`. You can type yes and hit return/enter after doing so if you do.\nYou’ll then see a message like You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. At this point, you’re all set!\nThis will be the only time you have to do this. From here on out, you’ll be able to “communicate” with GitHub from RStudio without typing your username/password.",

    "text": "Data\nThe data frame we will be working with today is called datasaurus_dozen2 and it’s in the datasauRus package. Actually, this single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualization is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading. The different datasets are marked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen. A question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file. This command must be ran in the Console.\n\nExercise 1\nBased on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the datasaurus_dozen file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report. When you’re done, commit your changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 1”, and push.\nLet’s take a look at what these datasets are. To do so we can make a frequency table of the dataset variable:\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  count(dataset)\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   dataset        n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 away         142\n 2 bullseye     142\n 3 circle       142\n 4 dino         142\n 5 dots         142\n 6 h_lines      142\n 7 high_lines   142\n 8 slant_down   142\n 9 slant_up     142\n10 star         142\n11 v_lines      142\n12 wide_lines   142\n13 x_shape      142\n\n\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) was created by Alberto Cairo in this great blog post. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice.3 In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets that the same summary statistics to the Datasaurus but have very different distributions.",

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nExercise 2\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of this exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0645\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nThis is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nYou should pause again, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”, and push.\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  group_by(dataset) |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1",

Just determine that a citation is necessary.)\n\nIn America, almost two-thirds of US trauma center admissions are the result of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs). Among these accidents, 60% result from drivers who test positive for a drug, and the most commonly-detected substances are alcohol and cannabis. Despite being federally illegal, cannabis use in America has increased steadily over the last 20 years, much of which has been attributed to its use being decriminalized and/or legal at the state level. Given its rise in popularity and the rate at which it shows up in toxicology reports completed at the roadside after accidents, public health concerns arise as to its safety while driving. Some states have recently begun to set limits for marijuana usage. Here, using a double-blinded randomized control trial, we identify a plausible biomarker for detection of recent marijuana usage for potential use at the roadside to determine if an individual has driven under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nDetermine two changes you would make to the above paragraph to improve its effectiveness (clarity, conciseness, etc.).

    "text": "Introduction\nThe main goals of this lab are for you to 1) get more familiar with the CS01 data and 2) for you to have one clean dataset by the end of lab - combining the blood, oral fluid, and blood datasets.\n\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, accept the lab02 assignment (link on Canvas), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. And, then you’re ready to go!\n\n\nPackages\nThe only package required for completion of this lab is tidyverse, as dplyr (which you’ll be using a lot in this lab) is one of the packages in the tidyverse. Be sure to import the tidyverse prior to completing the lab.\n\n\nData\nThe three data files you’ll be using in this lab have been provided in the data/ folder. You’ll see the following three lines in the provided .Rmd template for this lab, which, when run, will read each of the files into R for you:\nWB &lt;- read_csv(\"data/WB\")\nOF &lt;- read_csv(\"data/OF.csv\")\nBR &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Breath.csv\")\n\n\nExercises\n\nExercise 1: Whole Blood\nUsing the CS01 wrangling code from the dplyr lecture here, wrangle the whole blood data as we did in class.\n\n\nExercise 2: Oral Fluid\nIn a similar manner to how the whole blood data were wrangled and cleaned, carry out wrangling on the oral fluid dataset, accomplishing the following:\n\nTreatment re-coded and re-leveled as was done with WB\nGroup re-coded to match the levels in WB (Frequent user; Occasional user)\ncolumn names cleaned using clean_names() as with WB\nThe following columns renamed: thcoh = x11_oh_thc; thcv = thc_v; fluid_type=fluid\nThe following timepoints (note these are different than WB): \"pre-smoking\",\"0-30 min\",\"31-90 min\",\"91-180 min\", \"181-210 min\", \"211-240 min\",\"241-270 min\", \"271+ min\"\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Breath\nIn a similar manner to both previous datatasets, carry out wrangling on the breath dataset, accomplishing the following:\n\nTreatment re-coded and re-leveled as was done with WB/OF\nGroup re-coded to match the levels in WB (Frequent user; Occasional user)\ncolumn names cleaned using clean_names() as with WB/OF\nThe following columns renamed: thc = thc_pg_pad; fluid_type=fluid\nThe following timepoints (note these are different than WB/OF): \"pre-smoking\",\"0-40 min\",\"41-90 min\", \"91-180 min\", \"181-210 min\", \"211-240 min\", \"241-270 min\", \"271+ min\"\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Combine (time-permitting)\nCombine all three datasets into a single dataframe. Note that there is a function in dplyr called bind_rows() for accomplishing such a task.\nSave the file as a CSV file using the write_csv() function so that you have this file to start from in the future. (You do not need to submit this to GH; we’re doing it so that you have it.)\nYou’ll likely have to look up the documentation for each of these functions as they have not been directly covered in class yet.\n\n\nExercise 5: Summarize\nIn your own words (no code needed), describe the wrangling that was done overall, focusing on why it was done or what it achieved, rather than on specific lines of code.\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou’ll always want to knit your RMarkdown document to HTML and review that HTML document to ensure it includes all the information you want and looks as you intended, as we grade from the knit HTML.\n\n\nYay, you’re done! To finish up and submit, first knit your file to HTML. Be sure to select both your .Rmd and .html documents when choosing what to commit! Then, commit all remaining changes, use the commit message “Done with Lab 2! 💪”, and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.",

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this case study, we seek to analyze the youth disconnection among minority groups within the United States. The disconnected youth are the young people who are between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither working nor in school. Following the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2008, we witnessed a peak youth disconnection rate of 14.7 percent in 2010 which has since been trending downwards to as low as a youth disconnection rate of 11.5 percent in 2017. While analyzing racial and ethnic groups is imperative for viewing any evident disparities, we also intend on analyzing how gender may play a role in affecting the rates of disconnection. Seeing as how we can already see existing disparities between genders within the workforce, we also want to see to what extent, if at all, gender plays a role in youth disconnection among groups.\nThis specific period of young adulthood is one of the most critical in developing the necessary skills and capabilities required of them to be successful in adulthood and their professional careers as youth disconnection during this period stunts development and limits their potential. Measure of America, a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit Social Science Research, claims that “people who experience a period of disconnection as young adults go on to earn less and are less likely to be employed, own a home, or report good health by the time they reach their thirties”. Understanding how these trends among groups arise may be critical for finding solutions to preventing youth disconnection, and analyzing what groups may need more resources in order to prevent further prevent youth disconnection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nThis introduction is missing citations!

    "text": "The Data\nThe data set that we will be using for our case study is provided by two reports from the Measure of America project related to youth disconnect. The data provided will be in the form of images.\n\nData Import\nIn order to begin our analysis, we imported our raw data from the OCSdata library on youth disconnection.\n\n# Data is imported so I get overwrite error when not commented\n# Download raw data files\n# load_raw_data(\"ocs-bp-youth-disconnection\", outpath = '.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nReminder that you can control chunk behavior for each chunk within the curly braces. This also applies for the warnings that are displayed later on. Best to suppress those in final HTML.\n\n\nSince the raw data is in images, we need to convert to a usable R data set. We started with the major racial ethnic groups.\n\n## Import data for major racial/ethnic groups\nmajor_racial_ethnic_groups &lt;- magick::image_read(\"data/Major_ethnic_groups_screenshot.png\")\nmajor_groups &lt;- magick::image_ocr(major_racial_ethnic_groups)\n\nFor Asian subgroups, we had to import the raw data for 2017 and 2018.\n\n## Import data for Asian subgroups\n\n# 2017 data\nasian_sub_2017 &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_subgroups_2017.png\")\nasian_sub_2017_A &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_sub_2017_A.png\")\nasian_sub_2017_B &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_sub_2017_B.png\")\nasian_sub_2017_C &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_sub_2017_C.png\")\nasian_sub_2017 &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2017)\nasian_sub_2017_A &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2017_A)\nasian_sub_2017_B &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2017_B)\nasian_sub_2017_C &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2017_C)\n\n# 2018 data\nasian_sub_2018_A &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_sub_2018_A.png\")\nasian_sub_2018_A &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2018_A)\nasian_sub_2018_B &lt;- image_read(\"data/asian_sub_2018_B.png\")\nasian_sub_2018_B &lt;- image_ocr(asian_sub_2018_B)\n\nFor Latinx subgroups, we also imported 2017 and 2018 data.\n\n## Import data for Latinx subgroups\n\n# 2017 data\nlatinx_imageA &lt;- image_read(\"data/latinx_sub_2017_A.png\")\nlatinx_imageB &lt;- image_read(\"data/latinx_sub_2017_B.png\")\nlatinx_imageC &lt;- image_read(\"data/latinx_sub_2017_C.png\")\nlatinx_sub_2017_A &lt;- image_ocr(latinx_imageA)\nlatinx_sub_2017_B &lt;- image_ocr(latinx_imageB)\nlatinx_sub_2017_C &lt;- image_ocr(latinx_imageC)\n\n# 2018 data\nlatinx_sub_2018 &lt;- image_read(\"data/latinx_subgroups_2018.png\")\nlatinx_sub_2018 &lt;- image_ocr(latinx_sub_2018)\n\nOnce the data import is complete, we saved our data.\n\n# Save data\nsave(\n  major_groups,\n  asian_sub_2017,\n  asian_sub_2017_A,\n  asian_sub_2017_B,\n  asian_sub_2017_C,\n  latinx_sub_2017_A,\n  latinx_sub_2017_B,\n  latinx_sub_2017_C,\n  asian_sub_2018_A,\n  asian_sub_2018_B,\n  latinx_sub_2018,\n  file = \"data/imported_data.rda\")\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nJust a heads up this case study required A LOT more wrangling than your case study will. So, when your code is simpler/shorter for our first case study, that’s expected.\n\n\nNow that we have our data properly imported, we need to wrangle our data in R so we can begin our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nThere is text to guide the viewer, clear code, and code comments as needed. I like this.\n\n\n\nMajor Group Data\nTo begin our data wrangling, we took the imported data that is in a single string and separated the data by new line characters and transformed it into a table.\n\n# Separates string by new line and transforms into a table\nmajor_groups &lt;- major_groups |&gt;\n  stringr::str_split(pattern = \"\\n\") |&gt;\n  unlist() |&gt; \n  tibble::as_tibble()\n\nNow that our data has rows, we created columns Group and Year and assigned the corresponding values according to the data as well as normalizing the capitalization throughout the data set.\n\n# Separate into columns Group and Year\nmajor_groups &lt;- \n  major_groups |&gt;\n  tidyr::separate(col = value, \n                  into = c(\"Group\", \"Years\"), # Set column names\n                  sep = \"(?&lt;=[[:alpha:]])\\\\s(?=[0-9])\")  # Separate after letter string; beginning numerics\n\nWarning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 1 rows [19].\n\n# Make capitalization format the same\nmajor_groups &lt;- major_groups |&gt; \n  mutate(Group = stringr::str_to_title(Group))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nBy displaying these warnings in your output, it makes your report harder to read.

This means our data is likely not monotonic and we would fail to reject our null hypothesis that youth disconnection is decreasing over time.\nKnowing that the Great Recession occurred in 2008 and could provide an anomaly in our data, we ran a linear model on the data for 2010 and after.\n\n# Scatterplot with linear model for overall youth disconnection over time after 2010\nmajor_groups_long |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"All\", Race_Ethnicity == \"All_races\", Year != 2008) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Percent)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Youth Disconnection over Time (2010 and after)\",\n    subtitle = \"Includes linear model and standard error\",\n    x = \"Year\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph seems to show a stronger linear relationship between youth disconnection over time as there is a steeper slope and less standard error than our first linear model visualization.\nAgain, to test our hypothesis that youth disconnection does not have a decreasing trend over time for 2010 and after, we did another Mann-Kendall test.\n\n# M-K test for data after 2008\nmajor_groups_long |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"All\", Race_Ethnicity == \"All_races\", Year != 2008) |&gt;\n  pull(Percent) |&gt;\n  MannKendall() |&gt;\n  tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  statistic p.value kendall_score denominator var_kendall_score\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        -1  0.0275           -10          10              16.7\n\n\nThis time, the p-value is 2.75% and significant at the 5% level. Thus, this data set is likely monotonic and we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no decreasing trend between youth disconnection and time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nModel is not fully quantified nor explained in the context of the data.

    "text": "Results/Discussion\nThrough our exploratory data analysis, we observed that there does seem to be a decreasing trend of youth disconnection in the United States over the time frame of our data with the 2008 data being a slight anomaly. The decreasing trend with the exception of the initial 2010 spike remained generally consistent regardless of separation by gender, race/ethnicity, and both as seen through out first four visualizations. Although the trend is fairly consistent, there are additional takeaways from our visualizations.\nRace/ethnicity is a major determinant in the magnitude of youth disconnection rates while gender is a much weaker determinant. Through our third visualization we see that the Native American group has a youth disconnection percentage of about 25%, which is over three time the lowest group, Asian, at about 7.5%. The Black group, although not as high as Native American, has a youth disconnection rate higher than the overall average across the years at about 20% versus 13%. Additionally, every group’s rate is 2-5% different from the nearest group with no two groups being similar to each other. This leads us to believe that although a decreasing trend is apparent across all groups, groups still have differences in how disconnected their youth are. Gender, on the other hand, does not show the same disparity. Our second visualization shows that males may be more disconnected, but when broken down into race/ethnicity in our fourth visualization we see the effect of gender depends greatly on the race/ethnic group. Females are more disconnected in Latinx and Asian groups, while the youth disconnection rate is fairly similar across gender overall and in the Asian and White group. The Black group has the most interesting data where males are fairly more disconnected than females but even in other groups such as Latinx and Native American where there is a difference in female and male disconnection, it is not a major difference.\nIn taking a deeper dive into the Latinx and Asian subgroups in visualizations five and six, it can be seen that there are not big differences in youth disconnection between subgroups except in two cases. The South American subgroup has a substantially lower rate at about 8% versus the 12-15% range that the other Latinx subgroups are in. Oppositely, Hmong and Cambodia groups have a much higher youth disconnection rate at about 13% versus its Asian peers in the 4-7% range.\nTo quantify our observations in our exploratory data analysis, we created a linear model for our major group data and performed a Mann-Kendall test. The linear model shows a decreasing trend in youth disconnection rate over time but it does not seem to be a very strong relationship and has relatively high standard error. When performing the Mann-Kendall test, the p-value was 13.3%, which is not statistically significant at the 5% level, implying that there is not a monotonic trend in the data. We decided to create a second linear model and Mann-Kendall test without the 2008 data since youth disconnection likely increased in 2010 due to the Great Recession that the United States faced. When doing this, a much stronger decreasing trend can be seen in the linear model and the Mann-Kendall test has a p-value of 2.75%, which is statistically significant at the 5%, implying that there is a monotonic trend in the data. In this case, a decreasing trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nYour case study will need to discuss the limitations of your work.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nWhen taking account our entire data set, we cannot mathematically state that youth disconnection rates have changed over time, although visually and when excluding 2008 data, we can see that youth disconnection has been trending downwards starting in 2010 and after. This trend remains consistent across gender and race/ethnicity; however, there are still differences between groups in how disconnected are youth. Native American and Black are the most disconnected groups with Native American clearly have the highest youth disconnection rate. Although gender is not a major factor in determining youth disconnection in most cases, Black males are notably more disconnected than Black females. All other Latinx groups are more disconnected than the South American group and Hmong and Combodian groups are notably more disconnected than the other Asian groups. In conclusion, youth disconnection rates are experiencing a downward trend in 2010 and after and its magnitude is most heavily influenced by race/ethnicity in most cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Note\n\n\n\nBe sure that if someone read only your Question and Conclusion, they’d know the answer to the questions you’ve set out to answer.

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: Does R let you perform arithmetic across number and integer types?\nA: Yup! For example 7L + 2 gives you 9. (Similarly 7L + 2.2 gives 9.2)\n\n\nQ: I am confused on how to open up projects, what it means to comit and pull.\nA: We’ll review this again today!\n\n\nQ: I am very new to using Github, so using Github is a bit confusing, but probably just b/c I am very new to it.\nA: This is a normal feeling at the start of this course! I promise in a week it will feel more comfortable!\n\n\nQ: I’m curious about the usage of R versus Python. Are there certain situations where R is more useful than Python?\nA: In a nutshell, almost everything you can do in one you can do in the other. However, in my opinion, R is most useful when 1) cleaning data, 2) using statistical models, and 3) visualizing data. (On the flip side, when I’m writing software, using APIs, and gathering data, I typically turn to Python.)\n\n\nQ: How do I save my lecture practice into a new file in R?\nA: I would recommend opening a new .Rmd file and then saving it with the name of the lecture.\n\n\nQ: i noticed that global variables remain in the environment panel even when i delete that variable in my rmd script. does it matter that they are still there? i tried clicking the broom and rerunning the code, and only the variables i wanted remained, but is this the right way to go about changing or deleting variables in my code?\nA: Yup! The broom will clean up your environment! There is also an rm() function if you ever want to remove an individual variable from your environment.\n\n\nQ: Am I supposed to create an “R Markdown” or an “R Notebook”?\nA: I’ll demo R Markdown, so encouraging use of that.\n\n\nQ: Will we be covering any syntax guidelines when programming in R? For example, in other programming languages indents/spaces are necessary for many functions but I’m wondering if there is anything like that used in R.\nA: I will highlight them as we go! R does not necessitate whitespace ever, but stylistically, we will encourage it. What I teach will be based off of this style guide.\n\n\nQ: How many points are there in total for the extra credits\nA: I’m not totally sure yet. At least a few points.\n\n\nQ: I wonder what will be the format of the lab session?\nA: Typically a short presentation (5 min) at the beginning to explain the lab or discuss the most difficult/confusing part. Then, time to work on lab and get questions answered by staff.\n\n\nQ: Could you please post the slides one or two days before class? I would like to review them in advance so I can better follow along during the lecture and not feel lost.   A: I totally understand the request, and I’ll do my best! (For example, these have been up since Monday), but I’m re-doing the slides up to class many days. While the examples will change this quarter, the concepts will overlap with last Fall, so feel free to reference those notes.\n\n\nQ: What are the main parts of the R interface that we will be interacting with?\nA: RMarkdown files, R Console, Git pane, Files pane, and Plots pane\n\n\nQ: I had a question about the survey for participation. I’m usually busy right after class. Is there any way to get credit for it even if I submit it a couple of hours later or for it to open a little before class ends.\nA: I do typically end class a few minutes early for completion then and we’re working to open it a few minutes before class ends. It’s always fine to fill it out later if it’s open. It will always be open until at least 5PM."

    "text": "Q: Does R let you perform arithmetic across number and integer types?\nA: Yup! For example 7L + 2 gives you 9. (Similarly 7L + 2.2 gives 9.2)\n\n\nQ: I am confused on how to open up projects, what it means to comit and pull.\nA: We’ll review this again today!\n\n\nQ: I am very new to using Github, so using Github is a bit confusing, but probably just b/c I am very new to it.\nA: This is a normal feeling at the start of this course! I promise in a week it will feel more comfortable!\n\n\nQ: I’m curious about the usage of R versus Python. Are there certain situations where R is more useful than Python?\nA: In a nutshell, almost everything you can do in one you can do in the other. However, in my opinion, R is most useful when 1) cleaning data, 2) using statistical models, and 3) visualizing data. (On the flip side, when I’m writing software, using APIs, and gathering data, I typically turn to Python.)\n\n\nQ: How do I save my lecture practice into a new file in R?\nA: I would recommend opening a new .Rmd file and then saving it with the name of the lecture.\n\n\nQ: i noticed that global variables remain in the environment panel even when i delete that variable in my rmd script. does it matter that they are still there? i tried clicking the broom and rerunning the code, and only the variables i wanted remained, but is this the right way to go about changing or deleting variables in my code?\nA: Yup! The broom will clean up your environment! There is also an rm() function if you ever want to remove an individual variable from your environment.\n\n\nQ: Am I supposed to create an “R Markdown” or an “R Notebook”?\nA: I’ll demo R Markdown, so encouraging use of that.\n\n\nQ: Will we be covering any syntax guidelines when programming in R? For example, in other programming languages indents/spaces are necessary for many functions but I’m wondering if there is anything like that used in R.\nA: I will highlight them as we go! R does not necessitate whitespace ever, but stylistically, we will encourage it. What I teach will be based off of this style guide.\n\n\nQ: How many points are there in total for the extra credits\nA: I’m not totally sure yet. At least a few points.\n\n\nQ: I wonder what will be the format of the lab session?\nA: Typically a short presentation (5 min) at the beginning to explain the lab or discuss the most difficult/confusing part. Then, time to work on lab and get questions answered by staff.\n\n\nQ: Could you please post the slides one or two days before class? I would like to review them in advance so I can better follow along during the lecture and not feel lost.   A: I totally understand the request, and I’ll do my best! (For example, these have been up since Monday), but I’m re-doing the slides up to class many days. While the examples will change this quarter, the concepts will overlap with last Fall, so feel free to reference those notes.\n\n\nQ: What are the main parts of the R interface that we will be interacting with?\nA: RMarkdown files, R Console, Git pane, Files pane, and Plots pane\n\n\nQ: I had a question about the survey for participation. I’m usually busy right after class. Is there any way to get credit for it even if I submit it a couple of hours later or for it to open a little before class ends.\nA: I do typically end class a few minutes early for completion then and we’re working to open it a few minutes before class ends. It’s always fine to fill it out later if it’s open. It will always be open until at least 5PM.\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nStudent survey due Fri 10/4 (11:59 PM; #finaid)\nLab 01 now available (due next Thursday 10/10)\n\nNo in-class lab this Friday; Monday’s lab is happening\n\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\nNote:\n\nRun this in console once: options(download.file.method=\"wget\")\nWe’re going to start CS01 in lecture/lab before you know your group mates.\nReminder to Shannon: demo lab clone, push pull\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nData Intro\nPaper Results\nWrangle",

I’m familiar with using Matplot.lib, but it seems slightly different for ggplot2.\nA: You can directly control color in R. We’ll discuss that, but you can also use a ton of available color palletes. See here.You’ll find what you largely have in matplotlib but also additional palettes.\n\n\nQ: What are some common aesthetics options for graphs?\nA: Discussing this today!\n\n\nQ: Why in the world anyone would think that %&gt;% is an acceptable operator\nA: Hadley Wickham (the developer) has made SO many incredible updates to the consistency and syntax in R. This was just NOT one of them."

    "section": "Q&A",
    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: I’m slightly confused about the purpose of this line of code: facet_grid(treatment ~ group) when using facets\nA: facet_grid says to create a small multiple plot - meaning break down the overall plot into smaller subsets. Then treatment ~ group specifies how to do that breakdown. Have each row be a separate treatment. Have each column be a separate group. Then, in each sublot, plot only the data that pertains to taht treatment x group combination.\n\n\nQ: For things we want to alter that are not in ggplot, would we use a different package in combination with ggplot to alter things?\nA: Yup! There are TONS of extensions/add-ons that work well with ggplot2. Many are found in additional pacakges, so I’d start there. There is, additionally, plotting in R that happens outside of or is incompatible with ggplot2. There are times where you would want to go that route, but we won’t need to in this course.\n\n\nQ: I am a little confused on how to select the best practices. Are there multiple right answers at times?\nA: There are multiple “right” answers. Learn the basics about visual design and then decide in your case which of those rules to follow. It will often be all of them, but if a rule makes reading your particular visualization more difficult to follow, then break the rule in that case. The goal is clear communication and readability.\n\n\nQ: My lingering question is if there is support for violin plots.\nA: Yes! There is a geom for that: geom_violin\n\n\nQ: What I should be looking for/investigating from the case study data\nA: Ultimately, you and your group want to answer the question posed. We’ll discuss more about this today!\n\n\nQ: I’ve also used forestplot. Is this something that ggplot can also accomplish?\nA: Yup! There are standalone packages (not ggplot2-compatible) for this, but it’s also possible in `ggplot2."

    "text": "Course Info\nPractical Data Science in R focuses on teaching students how to think rigorously throughout the data science process. To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\nDays & Times\n\n\n\n\n\n Lecture: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (CSB 002)\n Lab: Mon 5-5:50 (DIB 121) or Fri 2-2:50 (RWAC 0103)\n\nInstructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n\n\nInstructor\nShannon Ellis\nsellis@ucsd.edu\nTu 11A-12P\nCSB 243\n\n\n\n\n\nWed 10-11A\nZoom by appt\n\n\nTA\nQuirine (Q) van-Engen\n\nTh 8:30-9:30A\nZoom (see Canvas for link)\n\n\nIA\nEric Song\n\n–\n–\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nProgram at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\nEmploy the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\nExplain & apply statistical and machine learning concepts for data analysis\nCommunicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n\n\n\nTexts\nTexts are freely available online:\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\nÇetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin\nOpenIntro, 2e, 2024\n\n\nR for Data Science\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund\nO’Reilly, 2e, 2023\n\n\nTidy Modeling With R\nMax Kuhn and Julia Silge\nO’Reilly, 1e, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nYou should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged (as possible).\nNote: If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed, please use this form to request a loaner laptop.

This course website was adapted from her course websites. Some of our course materials are also from her datascienceinabox project. I am so very indebted to Mine! I also want to thank the Open Case Studies team for their tireless work in putting together interesting and topical case studies, a handful of which have been used throughout the course over the years. And, finally, thanks to Allison Horst, whose artwork is inspiring, educational, and fun…and is used throughout this course. Further, thanks to the greater R (education) community who make planning and teaching R courses simply the best."

    "text": "If you’re having difficulty working in datahub, go to status.ucsd.edu. Known issues will be reported at the top of the page.\n\nIf no issue relating to “datahub” or “DSMLP” is noted, this suggests the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection. Then, if issue is not resolved, click “Control Panel” at top right and then “Stop my Server”. After a minute, click “Start My Server” to start a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course Ed with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots whenever possible).\nIf it shows an issue relating to “datahub” or “DSMLP”, this means there is a known incident with the datahub. This typically resolves quickly. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course Ed to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!",
