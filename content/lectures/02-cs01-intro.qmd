## Q&A {.smaller}

> Q: Does R let you perform arithmetic across number and integer types?\
> A: Yup! For example `7L + 2` gives you 9. (Similarly `7L + 2.2` gives 9.2)

> Q: I am confused on how to open up projects, what it means to comit and pull.\
> A: We'll review this again today!

> Q: I am very new to using Github, so using Github is a bit confusing, but probably just b/c I am very new to it. \
> A: This is a normal feeling at the start of this course! I promise in a week it will feel more comfortable! 

> Q: I'm curious about the usage of R versus Python. Are there certain situations where R is more useful than Python?\
> A: In a nutshell, *almost* everything you can do in one you can do in the other. However, in my opinion, R is most useful when 1) cleaning data, 2) using statistical models, and 3) visualizing data. (On the flip side, when I'm writing software, using APIs, and gathering data, I typically turn to Python.)

 
> Q: How do I save my lecture practice into a new file in R?\
> A: I would recommend opening a new .Rmd file and then saving it with the name of the lecture.

> Q: i noticed that global variables remain in the environment panel even when i delete that variable in my rmd script. does it matter that they are still there? i tried clicking the broom and rerunning the code, and only the variables i wanted remained, but is this the right way to go about changing or deleting variables in my code?\
> A: Yup! The broom will clean up your environment! There is also an `rm()` function if you ever want to remove an individual variable from your environment.

> Q: Am I supposed to create an "R Markdown" or an "R Notebook"?\
> A: I'll demo R Markdown, so encouraging use of that.

> Q: Will we be covering any syntax guidelines when programming in R? For example, in other programming languages indents/spaces are necessary for many functions but I'm wondering if there is anything like that used in R.\
> A: I will highlight them as we go! R does not necessitate whitespace ever, but stylistically, we will encourage it. What I teach will be based off of this [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

> Q: How many points are there in total for the extra credits \
> A: I'm not totally sure yet. At least a few points.

> Q: I wonder what will be the format of the lab session? \
> A: Typically a short presentation (5 min) at the beginning to explain the lab or discuss the most difficult/confusing part. Then, time to work on lab and get questions answered by staff.

> Q: Could you please post the slides one or two days before class? I would like to review them in advance so I can better follow along during the lecture and not feel lost. \ 
> A: I totally understand the request, and I'll do my best! (For example, these have been up since Monday), but I'm re-doing the slides up to class many days. While the examples will change this quarter, the concepts will overlap with last Fall, so feel free to reference [those notes](https://cogs137.github.io/website/).

> Q: What are the main parts of the R interface that we will be interacting with?  \
> A: RMarkdown files, R Console, Git pane, Files pane, and Plots pane

> Q: I had a question about the survey for participation. I'm usually busy right after class. Is there any way to get credit for it even if I submit it a couple of hours later or for it to open a little before class ends. \
> A: I do typically end class a few minutes early for completion then and we're working to open it a few minutes before class ends. It's always fine to fill it out later if it's open. It will always be open until at least 5PM.

- General Audience communication

## CS01: Biomarkers of Recent Use

- Focuses on Data Wrangling and EDA
- Uses real research data from a collaboration w/ Rob Fitgerald's group

## Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs)

-   2/3 of US trauma center admissions are due to MVAs
-   \~60% of such patients testing positive for drugs or alcohol
-   Alcohol and cannabis are most frequently detected

Source: [https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997]()

## Legalization of Marijuana

-   Federally illegal in the US
-   Decriminalized in many states
-   Medically available in 15 states
-   Legal for recreational use in 24 states (including CA)

## Increased roadside surveys

::: incremental
-   25% increase in use nationwide from 2002 to 2015 ([survey](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
-   THC detection in drivers increased by 48% from 2007 to 2014
-   Increased prevalence of consumption -\> possible intoxication -\> possible impaired driving -\> public health concern
:::

## DUI of Alcohol (DUIA)

::: incremental
-   The science is there. Don't do it.
-   DUIA has decreased since the 1970s
    -   \% of nighttime, weekend drivers testing over the legal limit (BAC \> 0.08 g/dL) decreased from 7.5% (1973) to 2.2% (2007) [link]((https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
:::

## DUI of Cannabis

-   In a 2007 survey, 16.3% of nighttime drivers were drug-positive [link](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913)
    -   8.6% of these tested positive for THC
-   Experimental and cognitive studies suggest cannabis-induced impairment increases risk of motor vehicle crashes:

. . .

> Evidence suggests recent smoking and/or blood THC concentrations 2–5 ng/mL are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.[link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997)

## Roadside Detection

-   *per se* laws: "a driver is deemed to have committed an offense if THC is detected at or above a pre-determined cutoff" [link](https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

. . .

-   Defining cutoffs for safe driving is difficult
-   THC concentration differs by:
    -   "smoking topography" (time to smoke; number of puffs)
    -   frequency of use
    -   route of ingestion

. . .

As of 2021...[link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

::: incremental
-   19 states have *per se* or zero tolerance cannabis laws
-   States with *per se* laws (Illinois, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia), cutoffs range from 1 to 5 ng/mL THC in whole blood.
-   In 3 states, *per se* limits also apply to THC metabolites
-   Colorado: "reasonable inference" - blood contained \>5 ng/mL THC at the time of the offense
-   3 states zero tolerance for THC; 8 states for THC and metabolites
:::

## Metabolism

::: incremental
-   peak blood concentrations occur during smoking, then drop rapidly [link](https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/36/6/405/791790)
-   subjective 'high' persists for several hours, varies greatly between individuals
-   THC concentrations remain detectable in frequent users longer than occasional users [link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/519/5622035)
-   THC and certain metabolites can be detected in blood for weeks to months after use and do not necessarily indicate impairment
:::

## Detection

Various approaches:

1.  Detect impairment (officers detect DUIC)
2.  Detect recent use (test for compounds)
3.  Combine recent use + impairment

. . .

**Focus here**: Can we identify a biomarker of recent use?

-   recent use: defined here as within 3h
-   testing THC and metabolites in blood, oral fluid (OF), and breath

## Aside: Case Study Report

-   Your Case study will need a background section
-   It can use/summarize/paraphrase the information here (you should cite the source, not me)
-   But, you're *not* limited to this information
-   You are allowed/encouraged to dig deeper, include what's most important, add to, remove, etc.
-   There are a lot of citations in this section - go ahead and peruse them/others/use references in these papers

# Question {background-color="#92A86A"}

Which compound, in which matrix, and at what cutoff is the best biomarker of recent use?

# The Data {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Participants

-   placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study

. . .

-   recruited:
    -   volunteers 21-55 y/o
    -   had a driver's license
    -   self-reported cannabis use \>= 4x in the past month

. . .

-   Participants were:
    -   compensated
    -   medically evaluated (for safety)
    -   asked to refrain from use for 2d prior to participation

## Experimental Design

Participants were:

::: incremental
-   randomly assigned to receive a cigarette containing placebo (0.02%), or 5.9% or 13.4% THC
-   Blood, OF and breath were collected prior to smoking
-   smoked a 700 mg cigarette *ad libitum* within 10 min, with a minimum of four puffs.
-   After smoking, 4 additional OF and breath and 8 blood collections were completed at time points up to ∼6h from the start of smoking.
-   Participants ate and drank water between collections, although not within 10 min of OF collection.
