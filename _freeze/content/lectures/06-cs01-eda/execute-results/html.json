Then `treatment ~ group` specifies *how* to do that breakdown. Have each row be a separate `treatment`. Have each column be a separate `group`. Then, in each sublot, plot only the data that pertains to taht treatment x group combination.\n\n> Q: For things we want to alter that are not in ggplot, would we use a different package in combination with ggplot to alter things?\\\n> A: Yup! There are TONS of extensions/add-ons that work well with `ggplot2`. Many are found in additional pacakges, so I'd start there. There is, additionally, plotting in R that happens outside of or is incompatible with `ggplot2`. There are times where you would want to go that route, but we won't need to in this course.\n\n> Q: I am a little confused on how to select the best practices. Are there multiple right answers at times?\\\n> A: There are multiple \"right\" answers. Learn the basics about visual design and then decide in your case which of those rules to follow. It will often be all of them, but if a rule makes reading your particular visualization more difficult to follow, then break the rule in that case. The goal is clear communication and readability.\n\n> Q: My lingering question is if there is support for violin plots. \\\n> A: Yes! There is a geom for that: `geom_violin`\n\n> Q: What I should be looking for/investigating from the case study data\\\n> A: Ultimately, you and your group want to answer the question posed. We'll discuss more about this today!\n\n> Q: I've also used forestplot. Is this something that ggplot can also accomplish? \\\n> A: Yup! There are standalone packages (not ggplot2-compatible) for this, but it's also possible [in `ggplot2    ](https://www.khstats.com/blog/forest-plots/).\n\n## Course Announcements\n\n**Due Dates**:\n\n- 🧪 **Lab 03** due Thursday (10/24; 11:59 PM)\n- 💻 **HW02** (Viz) due Mon (10/28; 11:59 PM)\n- 📋 Lecture Participation survey \"due\" after class\n\n**Notes**:\n\n-   **hw01** and **lab02** scores posted; Scores on Canvas; feedback as \"issue\" on GH\n-   **CS01 Groups** have been sent out\n    -   email for contact \n    -   GitHub repo \\<- please accept and open; make sure you have access; (or try: https://github.com/GHUsername/cs01-fa24-team##/invitations )\n    -   group mate feedback is required (on submission)\n    \n. . . \n\n::: callout-important\nThe CS01 data are data for you only.

(For example if an officer stopped a driver and got a high oral fluid, but could not get a blood sample for a couple of hours and got a relatively low result would this predict recent use better than blood (or OF) alone?\n-   Is there a ratio of OF/blood that predicts recent use?\n-   Machine learning model to determine optimal combination of measurements/cutoffs to detect recent use?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n-   some matrices are easier to get at the roadside\n-   time from use matters (trying to detect *recent* use)\n-   we may not care equally about sensitivity and specificity\n\n## cs01: what to do now?\n\n1.  Communicate with your group!\n2.  Discuss possible extensions\n3.  Make a plan; figure out who's doing what; set deadlines\n4.  Implement the plan!\n\n## What has to be done:\n\n::: incremental\n-   Question \\| include in Rmd; add extension if applicable\n-   Background \\| summarize and add to what was discussed in classed\n-   Data\n    -   Describe data & variables\n    -   Data wrangling \\| likely copy + paste from notes; add explanation as you go\n-   Analysis\n    -   EDA \\| likely borrowing parts from notes and modifying/adding more in to tell your story; be sure to include interpretations of output & guide the reader\n    -   Drawing conclusions to answer the question\n    -   Extension \\| must be completed\n-   Discussion & Conclusion \\| summarize; discuss limitations\n-   Proofread \\| ensure it makes sense from top to bottom\n-   General Audience communication (submit on Canvas; 1 submission per group)\n:::\n\n## Collaborating on GitHub\n\n-   Be sure to pull changes every time you sit down to work\n-   Avoid working on the same part of the same file as another teammate OR work in separate files and combine at the end\n-   push your changes once you're ready to add them to the group\n\n\n## Recap {.smaller background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n-   Can you explain/describe the plots generated in the context of these data?\n-   Can you generate EDA plots of your own for these data\n-   Can you understand/work through the more complicated code provided (even if you couldn't have come up with it on your own)\n-   Can you describe sensitivity? Specificity?\n-   Can you explain how TP, TN, FP, and FN were calculated/defined *in this experiment*?\n-   Can you describe the code used to carry out the calculations?\n-   Can you interpret the results from these data?\n",
