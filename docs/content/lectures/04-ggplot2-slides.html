<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I’m curious about the differences between base r pipe (|&gt;) and the %&gt;% operators! I’ve only learned about %&gt;% and it’d be interesting looking at the differences between using either one.<br>
A: There’s a <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/">blog post</a> for that!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: The most confusing part of this lecture was getting started with dplyr functions, but it will become easier with practice.<br>
A: Lots of people said something similar. And, this is definitely the right attitude! Lecture is for first exposure. Practice in lecture is to start underestanding. Labs are for guided practice where you have more time to practice. Case studies and homeworks are where we check our understanding! So, you’re not supposed to “get it” all the first time you see it in lecture.</p>
