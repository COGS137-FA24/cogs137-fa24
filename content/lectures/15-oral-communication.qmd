## [Peer Evaluation Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz4WZC8R1HQLj6-zdUNE_HWEwrJa7siBeP4uE0RZVEY4Sykw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

- each group received an email with their group to review (subject: `[COGS 137] peer review`)
- one peer eval form submission per group

. . . 

- Graded on completion...but make it as helpful to the other group as possible
- A more critical/negative review will NOT negatively affect the other team's grade...but it may help them improve!
- The more free text you provide the more helpful it will be

. . . 

- If the file you got was empty/just the template, you'll have a very quick time evaluating
