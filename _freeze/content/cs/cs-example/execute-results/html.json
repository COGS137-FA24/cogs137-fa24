The disconnected youth are the young people who are between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither working nor in school. Following the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2008, we witnessed a peak youth disconnection rate of 14.7 percent in 2010 which has since been trending downwards to as low as a youth disconnection rate of 11.5 percent in 2017. While analyzing racial and ethnic groups is imperative for viewing any evident disparities, we also intend on analyzing how gender may play a role in affecting the rates of disconnection. Seeing as how we can already see existing disparities between genders within the workforce, we also want to see to what extent, if at all, gender plays a role in youth disconnection among groups.\n\nThis specific period of young adulthood is one of the most critical in developing the necessary skills and capabilities required of them to be successful in adulthood and their professional careers as youth disconnection during this period stunts development and limits their potential. Measure of America, a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit Social Science Research, claims that \"people who experience a period of disconnection as young adults go on to earn less and are less likely to be employed, own a home, or report good health by the time they reach their thirties”. Understanding how these trends among groups arise may be critical for finding solutions to preventing youth disconnection, and analyzing what groups may need more resources in order to prevent further prevent youth disconnection.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Prof Note\n\nThis introduction is missing citations! Statements that are not your own original thoughts must be cited. See Effective Communication lecture for possible ways to cite. We don't care what format you use. We do care that you cite others' work. Also, definitely feel free to find information on the topic beyond what was presented in class.\n:::\n\n## Questions\n\n1)  How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?\n2)  In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected?\n3)  Does removing 2008 (pre-Great Recession time period) data points change our answer?\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Prof Note\n\nThe third question here was their extension. Note that this is an ok extension all things considered. But, explaining the why this is their focus and giving necessary background in the introduction would have been great.\n:::\n\n## The Data\n\nThe data set that we will be using for our case study is provided by two reports from the Measure of America project related to youth disconnect. The data provided will be in the form of images.\n\n### Data Import\n\nIn order to begin our analysis, we imported our raw data from the `OCSdata` library on youth disconnection.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data is imported so I get overwrite error when not commented\n# Download raw data files\n# load_raw_data(\"ocs-bp-youth-disconnection\", outpath = '.')\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Prof Note\n\nReminder that you can control chunk behavior for each chunk within the curly braces.

Be sure if you're stating things that are true and that you're quantifying them when possible.\n:::\n\n## Results/Discussion\n\nThrough our exploratory data analysis, we observed that there does seem to be a decreasing trend of youth disconnection in the United States over the time frame of our data with the 2008 data being a slight anomaly. The decreasing trend with the exception of the initial 2010 spike remained generally consistent regardless of separation by gender, race/ethnicity, and both as seen through out first four visualizations. Although the trend is fairly consistent, there are additional takeaways from our visualizations.\n\nRace/ethnicity is a major determinant in the magnitude of youth disconnection rates while gender is a much weaker determinant. Through our third visualization we see that the Native American group has a youth disconnection percentage of about 25%, which is over three time the lowest group, Asian, at about 7.5%. The Black group, although not as high as Native American, has a youth disconnection rate higher than the overall average across the years at about 20% versus 13%. Additionally, every group's rate is 2-5% different from the nearest group with no two groups being similar to each other. This leads us to believe that although a decreasing trend is apparent across all groups, groups still have differences in how disconnected their youth are. Gender, on the other hand, does not show the same disparity. Our second visualization shows that males may be more disconnected, but when broken down into race/ethnicity in our fourth visualization we see the effect of gender depends greatly on the race/ethnic group. Females are more disconnected in Latinx and Asian groups, while the youth disconnection rate is fairly similar across gender overall and in the Asian and White group. The Black group has the most interesting data where males are fairly more disconnected than females but even in other groups such as Latinx and Native American where there is a difference in female and male disconnection, it is not a major difference.\n\nIn taking a deeper dive into the Latinx and Asian subgroups in visualizations five and six, it can be seen that there are not big differences in youth disconnection between subgroups except in two cases. The South American subgroup has a substantially lower rate at about 8% versus the 12-15% range that the other Latinx subgroups are in. Oppositely, Hmong and Cambodia groups have a much higher youth disconnection rate at about 13% versus its Asian peers in the 4-7% range.\n\nTo quantify our observations in our exploratory data analysis, we created a linear model for our major group data and performed a Mann-Kendall test. The linear model shows a decreasing trend in youth disconnection rate over time but it does not seem to be a very strong relationship and has relatively high standard error. When performing the Mann-Kendall test, the p-value was 13.3%, which is not statistically significant at the 5% level, implying that there is not a monotonic trend in the data. We decided to create a second linear model and Mann-Kendall test without the 2008 data since youth disconnection likely increased in 2010 due to the Great Recession that the United States faced. When doing this, a much stronger decreasing trend can be seen in the linear model and the Mann-Kendall test has a p-value of 2.75%, which is statistically significant at the 5%, implying that there is a monotonic trend in the data. In this case, a decreasing trend over time.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Prof Note\n\nYour case study will need to discuss the limitations of your work.\n:::\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen taking account our entire data set, we cannot mathematically state that youth disconnection rates have changed over time, although visually and when excluding 2008 data, we can see that youth disconnection has been trending downwards starting in 2010 and after. This trend remains consistent across gender and race/ethnicity; however, there are still differences between groups in how disconnected are youth. Native American and Black are the most disconnected groups with Native American clearly have the highest youth disconnection rate. Although gender is not a major factor in determining youth disconnection in most cases, Black males are notably more disconnected than Black females. All other Latinx groups are more disconnected than the South American group and Hmong and Combodian groups are notably more disconnected than the other Asian groups. In conclusion, youth disconnection rates are experiencing a downward trend in 2010 and after and its magnitude is most heavily influenced by race/ethnicity in most cases.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Prof Note\n\nBe sure that if someone read only your Question and Conclusion, they'd know the answer to the questions you've set out to answer.
