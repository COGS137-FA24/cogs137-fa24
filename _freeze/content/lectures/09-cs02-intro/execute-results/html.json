I feel like I'm going to get this done via practice.\\\n> A: This is absolutely why we do two case studies! We don't expect you to get it perfect this first go around...but we also grade with that in mind and give feedback! We do expect students to improve by CS02 and incorporate our feedback going forward.\n\n> Q: I think it's just confusing thinking about how to naturally intertwine the extension into meaningful analysis.\\\n> A: This is the harder thing and is very group specific. We're happy to help as your group comes up with ideas.\n\n> Q: Not sure what to focus on for answering our main question\\\n> A: General advice: Use EDA to eliminate as many compounds as possible - which ones are definitely NOT good biomarkers of recent use. Then, once you have fewer matrix-compound combos to look at, do calculations on those remaining.\n\n> Q: How you would present some of your research to the public, what would you personally prioritize.\\\n> A: The most critical information while ALSO discussing the *necessary* nuance. For example, my fear with this work is that more people would be sent to jail/see consequences that should NOT. So, I wanted to always be sure to communicate findings *as well as* how people should NOT misinterpret/misuse these findings.\n\n## Course Announcements\n\n**Due Dates**:\n\n-   ðŸ’» **CS01** due Wednesday\n-   ðŸ”¬ **Lab 05** due Thursday\n-   ðŸ”˜ **CS01 Team Eval** survey due Thursday\n-   ðŸ“„ **Final Project Proposal** due Monday\n-   ðŸ“‹ Lecture Participation survey \"due\" after class\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- hw02 and lab04 feedback and scores posted\n\n## Mid-course survey (N=55; 57%)\n\nGenerally, things are going well, pacing is ok, and people are getting their questions answered.\n\nSome great suggestions: \n\n- Give us time in class to meet groups right after assignment\n- Keep instructions in same document for completion\n- More text in notes\n- More cs01 guidance/time\n- include some details about R in the wild\n\n# Planning Ahead {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## Group Formation (CS02 + Final Project)\n\n::: incremental\n-   CS02 and Final Project are completed in groups (4-5) that you choose\n    -   CS02 - we choose the topic\n    -   Final project - you choose the topic\n-   You specify that group by submitting your final project proposal (due Monday)\n-   I will create repos for CS02 and final project after proposals are submitted\n-   You will still submit feedback about your experience working with your group\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThe final project proposal [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXBztrZuK0CeB8p3YZWr6M37oe16DGazuow7_g9Ulr6AiyXg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n## Final Project\n\nCarry out a data analysis on a topic and dataset of your choosing\n\n::: incremental\n-   not something that has already been done\n-   pick a topic you care about\n-   asking and answering a small-ish, specific question OR building a model to complete a useful task\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Components**\n\n-   Proposal \\| week 7\n-   Rough Draft of report \\| week 9\n-   Peer Feedback \\| week 10\n-   Final Deliverable \\| Tues of finals week\n    -   report (.Rmd -\\> html)\n    -   3-5 min presentation\\*\n    -   general audience communication\n\n. . .\n\nNotes:\n\n::: incremental\n-   Groups will have the option to record their presentation or present in class during week 10 (EC; all group members must present)\n-   CS02 is also due week 9; these will be happening concurrently; that's why you're in the same group\n:::\n\n## Topic Brainstorming\n\nLet's brainstorm some topics together...\n\n# CS02: Predicting Air Pollution (Data) {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## Agenda\n\n-   Background\n-   Question\n-   Data Intro\n-   Wrangle\n\n# Background {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## OpenCaseStudies\n\nWright, Carrie and Meng, Qier and Jager, Leah and Taub, Margaret and Hicks, Stephanie.

(In fact, the term micro-environments describes environments within cities or counties which may vary greatly from one block to another.)\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"images/09/map_of_monitors.jpg\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-13-63){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\nLack of granularity in air pollution monitoring has hindered our ability to discern the full impact of air pollution on health and to identify at-risk locations.\n\n## Machine Learning offers a solution\n\nAn [article](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-13-63){target=\"_blank\"} published in the *Environmental Health* journal dealt with this issue by using data, including population density and road density, among other features, to model or predict air pollution levels at a more localized scale using machine learning (ML) methods.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"images/09/thepaper.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-13-63){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\nThe authors of this article state that:\n\n> \"Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) remains an important public health concern, although it remains difficult to quantify accurately across large geographic areas with sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent epidemiologic analyses have demonstrated the importance of spatially- and temporally-resolved exposure estimates, which show larger PM-mediated health effects as compared to nearest monitor or county-specific ambient concentrations.\"\n\n. . .\n\nThe article above demonstrates that machine learning methods can be used to predict air pollution levels when traditional monitoring systems are not available in a particular area or when there is not enough spatial granularity with current monitoring systems.\n\n. . .\n\nSo...we're going to do the same\n\n# Question {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n> With what accuracy can we predict US annual average air pollution concentrations?\n\nThis will specifically be at the granularity of zip code regional levels using predictors such as data about population density, urbanization, road density, as well as, satellite pollution data and chemical modeling data.\n\n# Data {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## The State of Global Air\n\nThe [State of Global Air](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/){target=\"_blank\"} is a report released every year to communicate the impact of air pollution on public health.\n\n. . .\n\nThe [State of Global Air 2019 report](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga_2019_report.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} (which uses data from 2017) stated that:\n\n> Air pollution is the **fifth** leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. It is responsible for more deaths than many better-known risk factors such as malnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Each year, **more** people die from air pollutionâ€“related disease than from road **traffic injuries** or **malaria**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"https://www.healtheffects.org/sites/default/files/SoGA-Figures-01.jpg\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga_2019_report.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\n> In 2017, air pollution is estimated to have contributed to close to 5 million deaths globally â€” nearly **1 in every 10 deaths**.\n\n![](images/09/2017deaths.png)\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga_2019_fact_sheet.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\nThe [State of Global Air 2018 report](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga-2018-report.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} (using data from 2016) separated different types of air pollution & found that **particulate pollution was particularly associated with mortality**.\n\n![](images/09/2017mortality.png)\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga-2018-report.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\nThe 2019 report shows that the highest levels of fine particulate pollution occur in Africa and Asia and that:\n\n> More than **90%** of people worldwide live in areas **exceeding** the World Health Organization (WHO) **Guideline** for healthy air. More than half live in areas that do not even meet WHO's least-stringent air quality target.\n\n![](images/09/PMworld.png)\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga_2019_fact_sheet.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Overall Improvement\n\nLooking at the US specifically, air pollution levels are generally improving, with declining national air pollutant concentration averages as shown from the 2019 [*Our Nation's Air*](https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2019/#home){target=\"_blank\"} report from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"images/09/US.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2019/documentation/AirTrends_Flyer.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## An Issue Nonetheless\n\n-   air pollution **continues to contribute to health risk for Americans**, in particular in **regions with higher than national average rates** of pollution that, at times, exceed the WHO's recommended level.\n-   important to obtain high spatial granularity in estimates of air pollution in order to identify locations where populations are experiencing harmful levels of exposure.\n\n. . .\n\nYou can see that current air quality conditions at this [website](https://aqicn.org/city/usa/){target=\"_blank\"}, and you will notice variation across different cities.\n\n. . .\n\n-   reports particulate values using what is called the [Air Quality Index](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi){target=\"_blank\"} (AQI).\n-   This [calculator](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.calculator){target=\"_blank\"} indicates that 138 AQI is equivalent to 50.5 ug/m^3^ and is considered unhealthy for sensitive individuals.\n-   Thus, some areas exceed the WHO annual exposure guideline (10 ug/m^3^), and this may adversely affect the health of people living in these locations.\n\n## Adverse health effects\n\n-   Adverse health effects have been associated with populations experiencing higher pollution exposure despite the levels being below suggested guidelines.\n-   it appears that the composition of the particulate matter and the influence of other demographic factors may make specific populations more at risk for adverse health effects due to air pollution. (For example, see this [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747){target=\"_blank\"} for more details.)\n\n## Monitor Data\n\n::: incremental\n-   Monitor data in this case study come from a system of monitors in which roughly 90% are located within cities.\n-   There is an **equity issue** in terms of capturing the air pollution levels of more rural areas.\n-   To get a better sense of the pollution exposures for the individuals living in these areas, methods like machine learning can be useful to estimate air pollution levels in **areas with little to no monitoring**.\n-   Specifically, these methods can be used to estimate air pollution in these low monitoring areas so that we can make a map like this where we have annual estimates for all of the contiguous US:\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAWOEGBXMVGQ7AS5PZ6UUOX6FY.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n</p>\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F10%2F23%2Fair-pollution-is-getting-worse-data-show-more-people-are-dying%2F&psig=AOvVaw3v-ZDTBPnLP2MYtKf3Undj&ust=1585784479068000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPCyn9fxxegCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAd){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThis is what we aim to achieve in this case study.\n\n## Limitations\n\n::: incremental\n1.  The data do not include information about the composition of particulate matter. Different types of particulates may be more benign or deleterious for health outcomes.\n2.  Outdoor pollution levels are not necessarily an indication of individual exposures. People spend differing amounts of time indoors and outdoors and are exposed to different pollution levels indoors. Researchers are now developing personal monitoring systems to track air pollution levels on the personal level.\n3.  Our analysis will use annual mean estimates of pollution levels, but these can vary greatly by season, day and even hour. There are data sources that have finer levels of temporal data; however, we are interested in long term exposures, as these appear to be the most influential for health outcomes.\n4.  These data are US-focused.\n:::\n\n## Supervised ML\n\nHere, we'll need:\n\n1.  A **continuous** outcome variable that we want to predict\n2.  A set of feature(s) (or predictor variables) that we use to predict the outcome variable\n\n. . .\n\nTo build (or train) our model, we use both the outcome and features.\n\n. . .\n\nThe goal is to identify informative features that can explain a large amount of variation in our outcome variable.\n\n. . .\n\nUsing this model, we can then predict the outcome from new observations with the same features where have not observed the outcome.\n\n(More details [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d){target=\"_blank\"})\n\n## Outcome\n\nThe monitor data that we will be using comes from [**gravimetric monitors**](https://publiclab.org/wiki/filter-pm){target=\"_blank\"} (see picture below) operated by the US [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n![](images/09/monitor.png)\n\n\\[image courtesy of [Kirsten Koehler](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2928/kirsten-koehler)\\]\n\n. . .\n\nThese monitors use a filtration system to specifically capture fine particulate matter.\n\n![](images/09/filter.png)\n\n[\\[source\\]](https://publiclab.org/wiki/filter-pm){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n. . .\n\nThe weight of this particulate matter is manually measured daily or weekly.\n\nFor the EPA standard operating procedure for PM gravimetric analysis in 2008, we refer the reader to [here](https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/pm25/spec/RTIGravMassSOPFINAL.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n. . .\n\nIn our data set, the `value` column indicates the PM~2.5~ monitor average for 2008 in mass of fine particles/volume of air for 876 gravimetric monitors.\n\n. . .\n\nThe units are micrograms of fine particulate matter (PM) that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter per cubic meter of air - mass concentration (ug/m^3^).\n\n. . .\n\nRecall the WHO exposure guideline is \\< 10 ug/m^3^ on average annually for PM~2.5~.\n\n## Data Import\n\nAll of our data was previously collected by a [researcher](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) at the [Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) who studies air pollution and climate change.
