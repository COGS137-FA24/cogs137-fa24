## Q&A {.smaller}

> Q: If we're presenting in-class, does this count as our general communication? And does this mean that our html/rmd has to be finished-ish by that time\
> A: It counts as your group's 3-5 min presentation. You still have to do a general communication. Your HTML does NOT need to be finished yet.

> Q: Can this group project be apart of my personal portfolio? \
> A: Absolutely! Both CS02 and final project can go into your portfolio!
