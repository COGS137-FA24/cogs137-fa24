To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\n#### Days & Times\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<font color=\"#92a76a\"><i class=\"fas fa-university fa-lg\"></i></font> **Lecture**: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (CSB 002)\\\n<font color=\"#92a76a\"><i class=\"fas fa-laptop fa-lg\"></i></font> **Lab**: Mon 5-5:50 (DIB 121) or Fri 2-2:50 (RWAC 0103)\n\n##### Instructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n|            |                                                |                  |               |                                                                        |\n|------------|--------------|------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| Instructor | [**Shannon Ellis**](http://www.shanellis.com/) | sellis\\@ucsd.edu | Tu 11A-12P    | CSB 243                                                                |\n|            |                                                |                  | Wed 10-11A    | Zoom by [appt](CSB%20243https://calendar.app.google/3o4hAmJgYfWg2SnL8) |\n| TA         | Quirine (Q) van-Engen                          |                  | Th 8:30-9:30A | Zoom (see Canvas for link)                                             |\n| IA         | Eric Song                                      |                  | --            | --                                                                     |\n\n### Course Objectives\n\n-   Program at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\n\n-   Employ the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\n\n-   Explain & apply statistical and machine learning concepts for data analysis\n\n-   Communicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n\n### Texts\n\nTexts are freely available online:\n\n|                                                                         |                                          |                     |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) | Çetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin              | OpenIntro, 2e, 2024 |\n| [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)                           | Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund | O'Reilly, 2e, 2023  |\n| [Tidy Modeling With R](https://www.tmwr.org/)                           | Max Kuhn and Julia Silge                 | O'Reilly, 1e, 2022  |\n\n### Materials\n\nYou should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged (as possible).\n\nNote: If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed, please use [this form](https://eforms.ucsd.edu/view.php?id=490887) to request a loaner laptop.

This course website was adapted from her [course websites](https://mine-cr.com/teaching/). Some of our course materials are also from her [datascienceinabox](https://datasciencebox.org/) project. I am so *very* indebted to Mine! I also want to thank the [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) team for their tireless work in putting together interesting and topical case studies, a handful of which have been used throughout the course over the years. And, finally, thanks to [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/), whose [artwork](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/) is inspiring, educational, and fun...and is used throughout this course. Further, thanks to the greater R (education) community who make planning and teaching R courses simply the best.\n",
