    "text": "Class\nClass will include short lectures, interactive activities, and time for group work. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course and get initial practice. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to further practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we‚Äôll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\nCourse components\n\nLecture\nLectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is encouraged if you‚Äôre feeling well. To help incentivize coming to class, there will be a daily participation survey that will open at the end of lecture and close shortly after each Tues/Thurs lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project Completion of all surveys will provide 0.8% extra credit on your final grade.\n\nReadings\nReadings will be suggested for some class days and are best completed prior to the day‚Äôs lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day‚Äôs lecture topics. These can also be a good source after class when studying or reviewing topics discussed in class.\n\n\nPodcast\nIn case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts here.\n\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are meant to give you deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will typically comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask and answer each others‚Äô questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.\nLabs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn a lot from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week‚Äôs lab.\nLab attendance is not required, but is definitely encouraged if you are feeling well as you‚Äôll learn a lot by engaging with others‚Äô ideas and getting questions answered in real-time.\n\n\nHomework\nAfter practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You are allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two case study mini-projects and a final project. Teams will be randomly assigned for the first case study, but you all will select your team for the second case study and final project (which will both be completed in the same team). By working with teammates throughout the course, you will also be able to use one another as a resource during labs and assignments.\n\nCase Studies\nWe will use case studies throughout the course to guide our learning of both programming in R and using that to analyze data. Specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the case studies, you will: 1) carry out the analysis presented in class as a group, 2) extend the analysis from class and 3) communicate your findings for both a technical and general audience.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will be completed in groups, where each group will carry out a data analysis on a topic and dataset of their choosing. Final Project groups will have to submit a proposal during week 7, a rough draft during week 9, will submit/receive peer feedback during week 10, and their final submissions Tues of finals week by 11:59 PM.\nFinal project submissions will include a 1) detailed data science report, 2) short (3-5 min) presentation of the project and 3) a general audience communication.\nProject groups will have the opportunity to present their projects to the class for extra credit during week 10. Groups that do not present to the class will submit their presentation as a recording.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade will be comprised of the following:\n\n\n\nAssignment (#)\n% of grade\n\n\n\n\nLabs (7)\n21% (3pt each)\n\n\nHomework (3)\n24% (8pt each)\n\n\nCase Study Projects* (2)\n30% (15pt each)\n\n\nFinal Project Proposal* (1)\n3%\n\n\nPeer Review* (1)\n3%\n\n\nFinal Report* (1)\n11%\n\n\nFinal Presentation* (1)\n4%\n\n\nTeam Evaluation Surveys (3)\n3% (1pt each)\n\n\n\n* indicates group submission\n\nFinal Grades\nTo calculate final grades, I use the standard grading scale and do not round grades up (given the numerous extra credit opportunities offered):\n\n\n\n97-100%\nA+\n\n\n93-96%\nA\n\n\n90-92%\nA-\n\n\n87-89%\nB+\n\n\n83-86%\nB\n\n\n80-82%\nB-\n\n\n77-79%\nC+\n\n\n73-76%\nC\n\n\n70-72%\nC-\n\n\n67-69%\nD+\n\n\n63-66%\nD\n\n\n60-62%\nD-\n\n\n&lt;60%\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate / missed work\nLate homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.\nThere are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.\nNote: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nWe will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you‚Äôve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it‚Äôs important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post privately on Campuswire to ‚ÄúInstructors‚Äù using the ‚Äúregrades‚Äù tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMy goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end. If you would like to provide that feedback anonymously, please use the anonymous Google Form.*\n\nWhat should you call me?\nMost students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that‚Äôs great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I‚Äôm also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr.¬†Ellis.\n\n\nWhat I should call you?\nI should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or online after the fact‚Ä¶however you‚Äôre most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.\n\n\n\nDisability Access\nStudents requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out to Professor Ellis directly.\nContacting the OSD can help you further:\n858.534.4382 (phone)\nosd@ucsd.edu (email)\nhttp://disabilities.ucsd.edu\n\n\nHow to get help\nClass time, lab, and office hours are all great! Online communication works too, via either the class Q&A platform or email. If contacting by email, it‚Äôs best to include COGS 137 in the subject line.\nBut, if you prefer to be anonymous (i.e.¬†If you‚Äôve been offended by an example in class, really disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn‚Äôt but would rather not share this publicly), please fill out the anonymous Google Form*.\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it‚Äôs not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon‚Äôt cheat.\nYou are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can be to ask yourself ‚ÄúCan I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I‚Äôm submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?‚Äù; you should be able to answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you‚Äôve submitted. (For the midterm, all work has to be completed individually and communication with other humans about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly beforehand.)\nA note on sharing / reusing code: The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You should use available resources (e.g.¬†ChatGPT, Copilot, StackOverflow, etc.), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g.¬†copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.\nPlease review UCSD‚Äôs academic integrity policies here.\nCheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing (sellis@ucsd.edu) your assignment as soon as possible to avoid it being graded as late.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nPlease refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)\n\n\nClassroom Observation Study\nThis quarter, I am taking part in a research study (NSF IUSE 2236318) investigating how STEM instructors use data about their own teaching practices to reflect on and iterate upon their practices.\nAs part of this study, two weeks of class will be video recorded. The first week of recordings will occur in week 2/3 of the quarter and the second week of recordings will occur in week 8/9.\nThe recordings will be centered on my instruction and not on you. Given that the purpose of this study is to accurately capture my teaching, it is important that you continue to behave as you normally would without video recording. Only members of the study team will have access to the video recordings and the raw data files will be stored on a password-protected Google Drive. Upon completion of the study, the video recordings will be deleted.",

    "section": "Q&A",
    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: How much of my experience in Java, C++, and Python help me with R?\nA: Tons! It‚Äôs always easier/faster to pick up a new programming language with familiarity in a prior language. Python would be the most similar to R from a design perspective, but there will still be R quirks. That said, if you‚Äôve used `pandas` in python for data analysis, that will be very overlapping.\n\n\nQ: Is attendance required to attend? I know the lectures are recorded, but I want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing out on anything if I were unable to attend for some reason.\nA: You can only get the lecture attendance extra credit by being in class on any given day, but that‚Äôs just extra credit. Nothing else is required. That said, I will be forming groups within those who regularly come to class for CS01 and there will be time to work on stuff in class. So, helpful to come, but not required.\n\n\nQ: Will assignments show up in DataHub?\nA: They won‚Äôt, but we‚Äôll talk about how/where to access them today/on Tues.\n\n\nQ: I‚Äôm wondering how library imports work like in Python or if that‚Äôs even a thing in R!\nA: It is a thing and we‚Äôll definitely get into it! There‚Äôs a package for almost everything in R (just like in python)\n\n\nQ: If you don‚Äôt submit the survey on time, will you still be assigned to the group of people that aren‚Äôt synchronously going to class?\nA: 1. If the survey is still open, you can submit. 2. Yes! I will be assigning group among people who regularly come to class. If you miss a day or two, that‚Äôs ok!\n\n\nQ: I‚Äôm not sure if I missed this in lecture but what is the difference between Rstudio and R, and when do we know which one to use.\nA: RStudio is the environment where we write R code. We‚Äôll be using RStudio exclusively‚Ä¶so RStudio will be your go to!\n\n\nQ: Could the lecture survey be due at the end of the day instead?\nA: I‚Äôll think on this! It will always be open for at least an hour."

Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nYou are encouraged to ask one another questions and work together, but each individual must turn in their own lab each week.",

Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub‚Ä¶and so you do not have to type in your username and password every time you want to communicate with GitHub from RStudio. A video here showing what these steps look like or feel free to follow the written instructions below:\n\n\nStep 1: Email and Username\nThe first step requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Terminal pane\nType the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:\n\n\ngit config --global user.email \"your email\"\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\"\n\nFor example, for me these are:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"sellis@ucsd.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"ShanEllis\"\n\nTo confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:\n\ngit config --global user.email\ngit config --global user.name\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate ssh key\nIn the terminal, you‚Äôll want to generate an ssh key by typing:\n\nssh-keygen\n\nAfter hitting enter/return to execute the above, you‚Äôll press return/enter three times to bypass specifying a location and passphrase.\n\n\nStep 3: Copy your ssh key\nFrom the terminal type:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nYou‚Äôll want to highlight and copy the full result of this command. It will start with ssh-rsa and end with something including dsmlp toward the end.\n\n\nStep 4: Let GitHub know your key\n\nIn your browser, navigate to https://github.com/settings/keys\nClick ‚ÄúNew SSH Key‚Äù\nSet title to DSMLP\nPaste what you copied in step 3 into the ‚ÄúKey‚Äù box\nClick ‚ÄúAdd SSH Key‚Äù\n\n\n\nStep 5: Finalize\nReturn to the terminal in RStudio and run the following command:\n\nssh git@github.com\n\nYou may see a message like `The authenticity of host ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be established`. You can type yes and hit return/enter after doing so if you do.\nYou‚Äôll then see a message like You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. At this point, you‚Äôre all set!\nThis will be the only time you have to do this. From here on out, you‚Äôll be able to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with GitHub from RStudio without typing your username/password.",

The different datasets are marked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen. A question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file. This command must be ran in the Console.\n\nExercise 1\nBased on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the datasaurus_dozen file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report. When you‚Äôre done, commit your changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 1‚Äù, and push.\nLet‚Äôs take a look at what these datasets are.

Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let‚Äôs slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we‚Äôre saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you‚Äôre visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g.¬†the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of this exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn‚Äôt make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear ‚Äì it‚Äôs dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let‚Äôs calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0645\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 2‚Äù, and push.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs.¬†x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nThis is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 3‚Äù, and push.\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs.¬†x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nYou should pause again, commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 4‚Äù, and push.\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don‚Äôt add a legend.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let‚Äôs plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  group_by(dataset) |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou‚Äôre done with the data analysis exercises, but we‚Äôd like you to do two more things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1",

Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\nDays & Times\n\n\n\n\n\n Lecture: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (CSB 002)\n Lab: Mon 5-5:50 (DIB 121) or Fri 2-2:50 (RWAC 0103)\n\nInstructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n\n\nInstructor\nShannon Ellis\nsellis@ucsd.edu\nTu 11A-12P\nCSB 243\n\n\n\n\n\nWed 10-11A\nZoom by appt\n\n\nTA\nQuirine (Q) van-Engen\n\nTh 8:30-9:30A\nZoom (see Canvas for link)\n\n\nIA\nEric Song\n\n‚Äì\n‚Äì\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nProgram at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\nEmploy the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\nExplain & apply statistical and machine learning concepts for data analysis\nCommunicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n\n\n\nTexts\nTexts are freely available online:\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\n√áetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin\nOpenIntro, 2e, 2024\n\n\nR for Data Science\nWickham, √áetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund\nO‚ÄôReilly, 2e, 2023\n\n\nTidy Modeling With R\nMax Kuhn and Julia Silge\nO‚ÄôReilly, 1e, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nYou should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged (as possible).\nNote: If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed, please use this form to request a loaner laptop.

Known issues will be reported at the top of the page.\n\nIf no issue relating to ‚Äúdatahub‚Äù or ‚ÄúDSMLP‚Äù is noted, this suggests the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection. Then, if issue is not resolved, click ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù at top right and then ‚ÄúStop my Server‚Äù. After a minute, click ‚ÄúStart My Server‚Äù to start a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course Ed with details on what you‚Äôve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots whenever possible).\nIf it shows an issue relating to ‚Äúdatahub‚Äù or ‚ÄúDSMLP‚Äù, this means there is a known incident with the datahub. This typically resolves quickly. If there‚Äôs a deadline coming up soon, post on the course Ed to let us know that there‚Äôs an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don‚Äôt anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!",
