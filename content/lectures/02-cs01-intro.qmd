<!-- - We're going to *start* CS01 in lecture/lab before you know your group mates -->

## Agenda

-   Background
-   Data Intro
-   Paper Results
-   Wrangle



# Background {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Case Studies in COGS 137

- Question + Data Provided
- Wrangling + Analysis Discussed/Presented in Class
- In groups: 
  - reproduce the analysis
  - extend the analysis

## Deliverables

- Full Rmd report (explanations, text and story matter!)
- General Audience communication

## CS01: Biomarkers of Recent Use

- Focuses on Data Wrangling and EDA
- Uses real research data from a collaboration w/ Rob Fitgerald's group

## Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs)

-   2/3 of US trauma center admissions are due to MVAs
-   \~60% of such patients testing positive for drugs or alcohol
-   Alcohol and cannabis are most frequently detected

Source: [https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997]()

## Legalization of Marijuana

-   Federally illegal in the US
-   Decriminalized in many states
-   Medically available in 15 states
-   Legal for recreational use in 24 states (including CA)

## Increased roadside surveys

::: incremental
-   25% increase in use nationwide from 2002 to 2015 ([survey](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
-   THC detection in drivers increased by 48% from 2007 to 2014
-   Increased prevalence of consumption -\> possible intoxication -\> possible impaired driving -\> public health concern
:::

## DUI of Alcohol (DUIA)

::: incremental
-   The science is there. Don't do it.
-   DUIA has decreased since the 1970s
    -   \% of nighttime, weekend drivers testing over the legal limit (BAC \> 0.08 g/dL) decreased from 7.5% (1973) to 2.2% (2007) [link]((https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
:::

## DUI of Cannabis

-   In a 2007 survey, 16.3% of nighttime drivers were drug-positive [link](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913)
    -   8.6% of these tested positive for THC
-   Experimental and cognitive studies suggest cannabis-induced impairment increases risk of motor vehicle crashes:

. . .

> Evidence suggests recent smoking and/or blood THC concentrations 2–5 ng/mL are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.[link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997)

## Roadside Detection

-   *per se* laws: "a driver is deemed to have committed an offense if THC is detected at or above a pre-determined cutoff" [link](https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

. . .

-   Defining cutoffs for safe driving is difficult
-   THC concentration differs by:
    -   "smoking topography" (time to smoke; number of puffs)
    -   frequency of use
    -   route of ingestion

. . .

As of 2021...[link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

::: incremental
-   19 states have *per se* or zero tolerance cannabis laws
-   States with *per se* laws (Illinois, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia), cutoffs range from 1 to 5 ng/mL THC in whole blood.
-   In 3 states, *per se* limits also apply to THC metabolites
-   Colorado: "reasonable inference" - blood contained \>5 ng/mL THC at the time of the offense
-   3 states zero tolerance for THC; 8 states for THC and metabolites
:::

## Metabolism

::: incremental
-   peak blood concentrations occur during smoking, then drop rapidly [link](https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/36/6/405/791790)
-   subjective 'high' persists for several hours, varies greatly between individuals
-   THC concentrations remain detectable in frequent users longer than occasional users [link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/519/5622035)
-   THC and certain metabolites can be detected in blood for weeks to months after use and do not necessarily indicate impairment
:::

## Detection

Various approaches:

1.  Detect impairment (officers detect DUIC)
2.  Detect recent use (test for compounds)
3.  Combine recent use + impairment

. . .

**Focus here**: Can we identify a biomarker of recent use?

-   recent use: defined here as within 3h
-   testing THC and metabolites in blood, oral fluid (OF), and breath

## Aside: Case Study Report

-   Your Case study will need a background section
-   It can use/summarize/paraphrase the information here (you should cite the source, not me)
-   But, you're *not* limited to this information
-   You are allowed/encouraged to dig deeper, include what's most important, add to, remove, etc.
-   There are a lot of citations in this section - go ahead and peruse them/others/use references in these papers

# Question {background-color="#92A86A"}

Which compound, in which matrix, and at what cutoff is the best biomarker of recent use?

# The Data {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Participants

-   placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study

. . .

-   recruited:
    -   volunteers 21-55 y/o
    -   had a driver's license
    -   self-reported cannabis use \>= 4x in the past month

. . .

-   Participants were:
    -   compensated
    -   medically evaluated (for safety)
    -   asked to refrain from use for 2d prior to participation
    -   exclusion criteria: OF THC concentration ≥5 ng/mL on day of study (n=7)

. . .

-   Study included 191 participants

## Experimental Design

Participants were:

::: incremental
-   randomly assigned to receive a cigarette containing placebo (0.02%), or 5.9% or 13.4% THC
-   Blood, OF and breath were collected prior to smoking
-   smoked a 700 mg cigarette *ad libitum* within 10 min, with a minimum of four puffs.
-   After smoking, 4 additional OF and breath and 8 blood collections were completed at time points up to ∼6h from the start of smoking.
-   Participants ate and drank water between collections, although not within 10 min of OF collection.

## Our Datasets

Three matrices:

-   Blood (WB): 8 compounds; 190 participants
-   Oral Fluid (OF): 7 compounds; 192 participants
-   Breath (BR): 1 compound; 191 participants

. . .

Variables:

-   `ID` \| participants identifier
-   `Treatment` \| placebo, 5.90%, 13.40%
-   `Group` \| Occasional user, Frequent user
-   `Timepoint` \| indicator of which point in the timeline participant's collection occurred
-   `time.from.start` \| number of minutes from consumption
-   & measurements for individual compounds
