Biomarkers of Recent Cannabis Use in Blood, Oral Fluid and Breath. *Journal of Analytical Toxicology*. 2021. [Link to paper](https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/45/8/820/6311388?login=false#303593274/).\n\n## OpenCaseStudies\n\n-   [OpenCaseStudies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/)\n-   Uses R/the `tidyverse`\n-   asks public health-centric questions\n-   goal: to teach statistical analysis/data science through case studies\n\n## What We'll Do\n\nFor each case study (2), during lecture:\n\n-   Stats: (1-2d)\n-   Background, Data & Wrangling (1-2d)\n-   EDA & Analysis (1-2d)\n\n. . .\n\nFor each case study:\n\n-   you'll also work with case study data in lab.\n-   you'll work in assigned groups of \\~3 students to complete a data science report\n\n. . .\n\nI will share previous student examples and we'll discuss pros and cons in coming lectures.\n\n## Data Science Reports\n\nWith your group, you will:\n\n-   carry out all steps of the analysis\n    -   some code will be taken directly from lecture\n-   add text/organize into a report\n\n. . .\n\n-   have to extend the case study\n\n. . .\n\nThis should be written at the level of a data science-knowledgeable undergrad.\n\n## General Communication Submission\n\nThis is (intentionally) *very* open-ended.\n\nYou need to communicate the most important aspect/finding/part(s) of your case study to a general audience (*any* undergrad).\n\n. . .\n\nWhat *might* this look like? \n\n- short TikTok like video \n- brief Youtube video \n- slides for an Instagram post \n- X (Twitter) thread \n- poster to be displayed next to an elevator \n- poster to be put on public bulletin boards \n- effective email communication\n\n## What does extend the case study mean? {.smaller}\n\nYou'll need to do something more on the topic beyond what is presented in class.\n\n. . .\n\nExamples:\n\n1.  Asking an additional question and answering it from the data provided\n2.  Finding an additional dataset and using it to add to the case study\n3.  Generating a handful of additional and very informative visualizations (beyond what's presented in class)\n\n## Grading\n\nGraded on:\n\n-   content (code, text, viz)\n-   report: effective written communication (clarity/content \\> grammar/spelling)\n    -   extension carried out\n-   effective general communication (effectively conveys message to a general audience)\n\n# Final Project {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## Final Project Logistics\n\n-   will be completed in groups of 3-4 students\n-   you get to choose the group\n-   I will ask Monday week 7 for your final project groups (If you are not in one, I will help)\n- You will submit a proposal week 8.\n- Final projects are due during Finals week\n\n## What is the final project proposal?\n\n- A short Google Form\n- you'll submit your topic and a few details about that topic (depending upon which option you choose)\n- Your idea *can* change after you submit your proposal\n- This has been added to help you start your project before finals week.\n\n## Final Project Details\n\nTwo possible paths:\n\n1.  Create a technical presentation on a statistics topic and/or an R package.\n2.  Carry out a data analysis\n\n## Option 1: Technical Presentation\n\n-   .Rmd document used to make slides\n-   \"Teaches\" the details of the R package/statistics topic\n-   Demonstrates how to use the package and/or carry out the statistical analysis in R\n-   Topic/Package must go beyond what was taught in this course or what you should have learned in an intro stats course\n-   Presentation Length: 10-15min\n\n## Option 2: Data Analysis\n\n-   .Rmd document used for data science report\n-   Asks a question, finds data, analyzes data (basically: a mini case report, but you find the data and formulate the question)\n-   Presentation Length: 3-5min (brief summary of the full report)\n\n## Where/when for this presentation?\n\n-   Submit by Tues of finals week at 11:59 PM\n\n## Should I be working on my final project now?\n\n...probably not\n\n. . .\n\nBut, you should start thinking about/**getting a group of 3-4 people together**. You'll need to submit who's in your final project group Monday of week 7.\n\n. . .\n\nYou'll need to have a general plan for your final project around **wk 8**. You'll submit a \"proposal\" Monday of week 8.\n\n\n## What is the \"general audience\" communication?\n\nConsider who the audience would be -\\> design for them\n\n. . .\n\nFor example, if you present on an R package, who would benefit from knowing about this package? How would you reach them? What can you design to inform them of what it is and get them to use it?\n\n. . .\n\nOr if you do a data analysis on a particular topic, what would you want others to know? How would you communicate that?\n",
