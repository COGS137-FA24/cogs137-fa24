## Q&A {.scrollable .smaller}

> Q: what does \|\> mean? Do we need to know a lot of how to code those examples from class?\
> A: Love that you're noting and questioning these things. We're going to discuss this today! You do not need to know the code examples...yet. We're going to discuss code starting today; this starts with what you'll need to be familiar with.

> Q: How to really extend the case study in our own time, when many information/analysis are already given in the lecture?\
> A: We'll discuss this more! But, specifically for this first Case Study. We're asking a very narrow question....but have a lot of variables. Is there some subgroup you could focus on? A different time window? A combination of compounds? Etc.

> Q: How can we do more complex math in R?\
> A: Depends on what kind of complex math you're aiming to do - a lot of complex math is built directly into R; other things would require additional packages.

> Q: Where can I find the full study on the data we reviewed in class. Seems like something I'd like to read and perhaps play with the data myself.\
> A: We're going to discuss the results today! But, the links are inlcuded in the notes (in what we didn't get to yet.)

> Q: How did the police officers do to detect cognitive impariedness with marijuana consumption?\
> A: Not great (not better than flipping a coin). We'll discuss this today!

> Q: Why were the numeric types in the cat lovers data frame labeled as 'dbl' instead of numeric?\
> A: There are multiple "levels" of object type in R (which I did not make clear in lecture b/c it's not important for this class). Double is a subset of numeric. If you ask for `type()` rather than `class()` you'll see this difference.

> Q: In class, we used \|\> as a pipe operator. Is it fine if we use %\>% instead? Do you have a preference between the two? Thank you!\
> A: We'll discuss this today - no preference!

> Q: My github username is pretty weird. How are the professor and TA going to know that it is me if my username does not resemble my actual name?\
> A: On your first lab, we ask you to put your name in the author field. We use that to match students to their GH usernames!

# Pipes {background-color="#92A86A"}

## The pipe in baseR

<p align="center">

<img src="images/03/baseR_hex.jpeg" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>

</p>

-   `|>` should be read as "and then"
-   for example "Wake up \|\> brush teeth" would be read as "wake up *and then* brush teeth"

## Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator was *first* implemented in the package **magrittr**.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/03/magritte.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/03/magrittr.jpg)
:::
:::

You will see this frequently in code online. It's equivalent to `|>`.

## How does a pipe work?

-   You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.

. . .

-   Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

. . .

-   Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") |>
  start_car() |>
  drive(to = "campus") |>
  park()
```

. . .

## Variables

View the names of variables via:

```{r}
names(WB)
```

## Viewing your data

-   In the Environment, click on the name of the data frame to view it in the data viewer (or use the `View` function)

-   Use the `glimpse` function to take a peek

```{r}
glimpse(WB)
```

# `dplyr` {background-color="#92A86A"}

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation {.smaller .scrollable}

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

Single data frame functions / verbs:

-   `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
-   `mutate`: add new variables
-   `select`: pick columns by name
-   `rename`: rename specific columns
-   `summarize`: reduce variables to values
-   `arrange`: reorder rows
-   `distinct`: filter for unique rows
-   `pull`: grab a column as a vector
-   `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
-   `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
-   ... (many more)

## **`dplyr`** rules for functions

1.  First argument is *always* a data frame

2.  Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

3.  Always return a data frame

4.  Do not modify in place

5.  Performance via lazy evaluation

## Filter rows with `filter`

-   Select a subset of rows in a data frame.
-   Easily filter for many conditions at once.

## `filter` (single condition)

for only measurements from Occasional users

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  filter(Group == "Occasional user")
```

## `filter` (mutiple conditions)

for only measurements from Occasional users where THC \> 100

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  filter(Group == "Occasional user", THC > 100)
```

## select\` a range of variables

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  select(ID:`FLUID TYPE`)
```

-   `ID:FLUID TYPE`: take all columns from `ID` through `FLUID TYPE`
-   `FLUID TYPE` has backticks due to space in column name

## `select` to keep range + others

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  select(ID:`FLUID TYPE`, THC, time.from.start)
```

## `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  select(-Timepoint)
```

## `select` can rename columns

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB |>
  select(ID:`FLUID TYPE`, THC, start_time = time.from.start)
```

## "Save" when you make dataset changes

-   decide if you want to overwrite original or create new

```{r}
WB_sub <- WB |>
  select(ID:`FLUID TYPE`, THC, start_time = time.from.start)
```

## Check before you move on

Always check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

```{r}
names(WB_sub)
```

## `rename` specific columns

Useful for correcting typos, and renaming to make variable names shorter and/or more informative

-   Original names:

```{r}
names(WB_sub)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB_sub <- WB_sub |>
  rename(fluid_type = `FLUID TYPE`)
```

## `mutate` to add new variables

-   Note assigning back out to itself with new column

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

(WB_sub <- WB_sub |> 
  mutate(baseline = start_time < 0))
```

## Your Turn

How many baseline measurements had a THC value greater than zero?

:::

## `group_by` + `summarize` to reduce variables to values

The values are summarized in a data frame:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"

WB_sub |>
  group_by(Treatment, Group) |>
  summarize(count = n())
```

## `count` to group by then count

Same as last example, but summarize, not limited to counting

```{r}
WB_sub |>
  count(Treatment, Group)
```

## Your Turn

You're starting to work on the case study and you get curious. How many non-baseline observations have a THC \> 50. Does this number differ by treatment or group?

## and `arrange` to order rows

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"

WB_sub |>
  arrange(THC)
```

. . .

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Â  If you wanted to arrange these in descending order what would you add to the code?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

How many unique participants?

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB_sub |> 
  distinct(ID) 
```

## `distinct` has a `.keep_all` parameter

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

WB_sub |> 
  distinct(ID, .keep_all=TRUE) 
```

. . .

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Â  Which observation did `dplyr` decide to keep?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

# Factors {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Factors

Factor objects are how R stores data for categorical variables (fixed numbers of discrete values).

```{r}
(x = factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS")))
```

```{r}
glimpse(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

. . .

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> Â  In our data, which variables should be treated as factors?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

## Why does it matter?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
WB_sub |> 
  filter(start_time > 0, start_time < 60) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Treatment, y=THC)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Note: we'll discuss this specific code soon.

## Use `forcats` to manipulate factors

-   `fct_recode` - treat as factor; give new labels
-   `fct_relevel` - change order of levels

```{r}
WB_sub <- WB_sub |>
  mutate(Treatment = fct_recode(Treatment, 
                                "5.9% THC (low dose)" = "5.90%",
                                "13.4% THC (high dose)" = "13.40%"),
         Treatment = fct_relevel(Treatment, "Placebo", "5.9% THC (low dose)"))
```

. . .

(same plotting code as earlier)

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
WB_sub |> 
  filter(start_time > 0, start_time < 60) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Treatment, y=THC)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

## `forcats` functionality <img src="images/01/hex-forcats.png" width="10%" align="left"/>

-   R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.

-   factors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the `forcats` package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.

                                "13.4% THC (high dose)" = "13.40%"),
