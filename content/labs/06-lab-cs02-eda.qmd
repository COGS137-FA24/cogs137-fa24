# Introduction

The main goals of this lab are for you to really deepen your knowledge surrounding the CS02 data by continuing EDA beyond what was presented and discussed in class.

# Getting started

To get started, accept the lab06 assignment (link on Canvas/course website), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. And, then you're ready to go!

# Packages

Be sure to import the `tidyverse` prior to completing the lab. Additional packages are allowed, but not expected nor required.

# Data

In this lab, you'll start from the data provided with your lab:

``` r
pm_data <- read_csv("data/pm25_data.csv")
```

# Exercises

## Part 1: Deeper knowledge through EDA

### Exercise 1

Consider all we have discussed and learned through the EDA presented in class. Now, carry out additional EDA to learn something beyond what was previously displayed/discussed in class. This may be a single plot. It may be more than one plot. It could be a table....or multiple tables. But, work to fully understand the data to the best of your abilities.

### Exercise 2

Describe what new information you learned from what you generated above.

## Part 2: Possible extensions?

### Exercise 3

Think about the data you have access to, the background discussed in class, and the question each group has been asked to address. What *possible* extensions to this analysis would you be interested in carrying out? This is a space for brainstorming. Include any possible thoughts you have here, even if they aren't "good" or you aren't sure if they are "possible." This can be used as a jumping off point for when you start discussing analysis extensions with your group.
