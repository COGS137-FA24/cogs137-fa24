I didn’t understand what made them so different \\\n> A: You're right that they're very similar and can even at times be used/coerced to do what the other does. Basically, if you want a 2D comparison (variable1 x variable2), `facet_grid`. If you just want to break down the plots by a single variable, `facet_wrap`. \n\n> Q: Will future HW assignments also include things that were not explicitly covered in class? For example, HW1 which was due last night, included concepts and materials that were just covered today. \\\n> A: Nope. That was my fault. We were behind where I intended to be. This will not be an issue going forward.\n\n> Q: can we plot data from 2 separate data frames somehow? \\\n> A: Not typically in `ggplot2`. Instead, data would have to be wrangled into the tidy format (single dataset) first.\n\n> Q: does filling= mean seperate and color by the value passed in, and we don't need to assign color again? What if we don't want color? \\\n> A: Fill indicates how to fill the plot with color. If you don't want color, you wouldn't use fill\n\n> Q: How we would do the second suggestion in how to visualize the brexit data differently? \\\n> A: We'll do this together today!\n\n> Q: for datasets that are included in a library (like penguins one), could we read it into a df to see it in the environment? or is that redundant and we should only view it, use functions to see var names, etc \\\n> A: That would be ok!\n\n> Q: I was wondering where I can find all available themes. \\\n> A: [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html]()\n\n> Q: I have heard about plotly before. I was wondering what will be its difference between this and ggplot? \\\n> A: There is a ggplotly package! Plotly enables interaction on top of `ggplot2` packages\n\n## Course Announcements\n\n**Due Dates**:\n\n-   **Lab 03** due Friday (11:59 PM)\n-   Lecture Participation survey \"due\" after class\n\n. . . \n\n**Notes**:\n\n-   How To: Chunk output in console\n\n. . . \n\n- Case Studies Discussion\n  -  Biomarkers of recent marijuana usage (Linear Regression)\n  -  Vaping in American Youth (Logistic Regression)\n  -  Right-to-Carry Laws Effect on Violent Crime (Multiple Linear Regression)\n  -  Predicting Annual Air Pollution (Machine Learning)\n  \n## \\[ad\\] CSS Masters\n\n![](images/06/CSS.png)    \n\n## Agenda\n\n-   Discuss Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n-   Introduce modelling as a concept\n-   Paintings example\n    -   EDA\n    -   Modelling (Linear)\n    \n## Suggested Reading\n\n-   Introduction to Modern Statistics Chapter 4: [Exploring Categorical Data](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/explore-categorical.html)\n\n-   Introduction to Modern Statistics Chapter 5: [Exploring Numerical Data](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/explore-numerical.html)\n\n-   R4DS Chapter 22: [Introduction to Modelling](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html)\n\n-   R4DS Chapter 23: [Model Basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html)\n\n-   R4DS Chapter 24: [Model Building](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## What is EDA?\n\n-   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an aproach to analyzing data sets to summarize and understand its main characteristics.\n\n-   Often, this is visual....but the visuals do not have to be *perfect*. (Save that for communication)\n\n-   Calculating summary statistics is also part of EDA.\n\n. . .\n\n-   Data tidying/wrangling/manipulation/transformation typically happens before this stage of the analysis.\n\n. . .\n\nThe Goal: *KNOW* YOUR DATA!\n\n## Consider: No. of variables involved\n\n-   **Univariate data analysis** - distribution of single variable\n\n-   **Bivariate data analysis** - relationship between two variables\n\n-   **Multivariate data analysis** - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Consider: Types of variables\n\n-   **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.\n\n-   If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.\n\n## Data visualization\n\n> *\"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device.\" --- John Tukey*\n\n-   Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.\n\n-   There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**`ggplot2`** is what we'll continue to use).\n\n-   EDA will involve making plots/visualizing your data\n\n# Data: Paris Paintings {background-color=\"#92A86A\"}\n\n## Paris Paintings {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npp <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COGS137/datasets/main/paris_paintings.csv\", \n               na = c(\"n/a\", \"\", \"NA\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Source: Printed catalogs of 28 auction sales in Paris, 1764 -
